Similar figures of figure 5 of the reference publication have been produced with k_delay set to 18.6 as opposed to 38.6 as listed in table 2 of the reference publication. Additionally, the values of Sti_apo_g and Sti_apo_b were not found in the reference publication and were set to 0. The parameter k_tau, altough listed in table 2, was not used. 

The figures illustrate the fraction of live/proliferating cells in G0/G1 (blue), S (red) and G2/M (green) phases over a period of 100 hours. The top row represents the control case where both drug concentrations are set to 0. The effects of germcitabine, birinapant and combination treatment on cell cycle phase transition are illustrated in the second, third and bottom row respectively with increasing drug concentration from left to right. 20nm germcitabine + 500 nM birinapant treatment resulted in a large quantity of cells remaining in the S phase for an extended period of time, thus preventing transition to M phase.

One discrepancy, for example, is that the red curve for figure 5J (bottom right) starts to decrease after approximately t=25 whereas in the reference publication it is monotonically increasing until approximately t=80. Despite the y-axis being labelled as 'Cell Fraction', if the raw/non-scaled values of G1, S and G2 are plotted, the curated figure will be more similar to the figure in the reference publication.

The simulations were performed in COPASI V4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated in MATLAB R2014.
