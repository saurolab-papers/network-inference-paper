The paper has a Flux V/s Sensitivity bar chart (figure 5) of the signalling components that are at the crosstalk points and those that show high PCA (Principal component analysis) score. Here, time-course of the fluxes of the corresponding components (components at the crosstalk points and the components that show high PCA score) of figure 5 of the papers is produced. Simulation was done using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55). The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
