?Figure 4e of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the no MEK inhibition (MEKI=0) condition. To obtain simulations for MEK inhibition set MEKI=300 or 500. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
