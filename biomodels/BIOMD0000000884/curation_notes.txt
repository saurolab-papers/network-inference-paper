The model has been encoded using COPASI 4.24 (Build 197) and the Figure 1 of the publication has been reproduced using ggplot package in R. 

The model included initial concentration of L = 1e4 , U = 99e4 and V = 0. The authors used logarithm on both x axis and y axis for the generation of the figure and as there are certain 0 present in the U (uninfected) data, the logarithm produced Nan Value for them and those are missing in the graph. Apart from them the model figure is reproducible to the one published in the paper
