Reproduction of figure 5 from the original publication using Copasi 4.6. The total concentration of ERK was 1000 nM, the one of MKP 180 nM. To obtain all steady states, two parameter scan were performed. One over the initial concentration of MEK from 300 to 400 nM with 100 intervals, and one over the initial concentration of ERK from 100 to 600 nM with 10 intervals. To assure the total concentration of ERK was 1000, ERKpp was set by the initial condition: 1000 - ERK(t=0).
