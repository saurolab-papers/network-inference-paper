The model reproduces figure 5b,5c and 5d of the reference publication. The y-axis of the plots in the paper are rescaled. To reproduce the plot in the paper, 1) multiply model variable measIRp by a scaling factor of 31.8, 2) multiply model variable measIRS1 by a scaling factor of 21.2 and 3) multiply model variable IRmem by a scaling factor of 10. 

The model simulation was done using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35). The data were obtained from Copasi and plotted using Gnuplot.
