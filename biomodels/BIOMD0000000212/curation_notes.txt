Reproduction of figure 7c of the original publication using Copasi 4.6. Steady states were calculated over a range of values for the maximal velocity of tRNA synthetase, V_max_AA_RS using the parameter scan task of Copasi (250 intervals from 0.15 to 2 uM/s). As steady state fluxes in the protein branches, the fluxes through the Lys, Thr, and Ile tRNA synthetase reactions were taken.
