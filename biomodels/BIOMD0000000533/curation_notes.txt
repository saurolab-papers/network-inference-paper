Figure 3 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The mathematical model proposed by the authors fits with experimental data from "Kirkitadze et al., (2001) - Identification and characterization of key kinetic intermediates in amyloid beta-protein fibrillogenesis". 

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link.
