Figures 2, 7 and 9 of the reference publication have been reproduced here. Protein aggregation from the literature is fitted over time by the Finke-Watze 2-step model. 
- Figure 2 (left).  Amyloid β aggregation, hypothesized cause for pathology of Alzheimer's disease
- Figure 7 (center).  α-Synuclein aggregation, hypothesized cause for pathology of Parkinson's disease
- Figure 9 (right). Polyglutamine aggregation,  hypothesized cause for pathology of Hungington's disease

Note: Initial concentrations (A0) have been defined using Parameter Scan in order to match the simulation with the figures in the reference publication. Simulated values are 3.55 on Figure 2, 103 on Figure 7 and 98 on Figure 9.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
