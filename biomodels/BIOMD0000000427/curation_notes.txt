The model reproduce figure 2a of the reference publication, by setting EGFR_active = 8000 and IGFR_active = 650. 

The initial concentrations for reproducing figure 2b and 2c can be obtained from the matlab file of model, which accompanies the reference publication.

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
