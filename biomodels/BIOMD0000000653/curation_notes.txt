Figures 3 F of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the mutated brad condition (Purple line). The blue line and black line corresponds to the simulation in the presence (W=1) and absence (W=0) of Wnt from normal condition model (BIOMD0000000648).  The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
