Quantitative modelling of the A? response across a range of inhibitor concentrations in two cell types (see below) from Figure 3 has been reproduced here. Percent of A? concentration after 16 hours along a range of inhibitor concentration (log scale -2 to 4) respect A? concentration when no drug treatment is applied.

APPwt = cell type within wild type APP 
APPswe = cell type within Swedish mutation APP 
DAPT = gamma-secretase inhibitor drug N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester 

Reactions for different conditions are found in Table 1 and 2 of the paper. 
Secretase and inhibitor parameter values are found in Table S1a and S1b of the Supplementary section. 

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. Figure 3 is simulated by dividing the drug condition output by the no-drug condition output. The models with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below links:
