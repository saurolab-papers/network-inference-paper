Similar figures of figure 4 of the reference publication have been produced with Psi_i=1 and Psi_s=1 as opposed to Psi_i=0.582 and Psi_s=0.583 for figures 4E and 4F as listed in table 1 of the reference publication. 

The figures illustrate the number of proliferating (left) and dead (right) cells after 100 hours of gemcitabine (top), birinapant (middle) and combination (bottom) treatment. Black, blue, green and red curves correspond to increasing drug concentration, as used in the reference publication. The number of proliferating cells decreased after a combination of 20nM gemcitabine + 500 nM birinapant (figure 4E, bottom left, red curve). 

The simulations were performed in COPASI V4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated in MATLAB R2014.
