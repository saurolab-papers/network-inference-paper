Figure 1a of the reference publication has been reproduced here: Inhibition of amyloid fibrillization as predicted by the Crystallization-like model (CLM) for sigmoidal aggregation kinetics. 
Black curve represent the normalized fibril mass increase as a function of time (20 arbitrary units). Blue and red curves represent the inhibition of the nucleation and growth steps (true inhibition), respectively; green curve represent the apparent inhibition. The variation of parameters relatively to the normalized mass increase is indicated in the legend. 

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
