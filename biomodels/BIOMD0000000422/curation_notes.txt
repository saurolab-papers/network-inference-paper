This model corresponds to the full model that is described in the reference publication. The model parameter corresponds to wild-type and reproduces Figure 4C wild-type with R=1. The simulation runs for 500 time units (minutes) to allow the system to approach its steady state, then adds exogenous hormone for 120 time units, before removing the exogenous hormone until a total time of 800. So, the total run time is 800 minutes, having exogenous hormone between time points 500 and 620 (120 mins). In the paper, time is shifted so that t=0 corresponds to the addition of hormone, i.e. 500mins. The plot here show the time-course simulation between 500 mins(t=0 in the paper) and 800 mins (t=300 in the paper). The y-axis scale in the paper is in nM, whereas in the model it is in ?M.

The plot date were obtained by simulating the model using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
