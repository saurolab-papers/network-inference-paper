Figure 15 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. Dynamics of protofibrils, fibrils and Lewy bodies are plotted over 100 time units. 
This figure displays a percentage comparison of a disease model, where levels of α-synuclein in the system are increased by 10%, and the baseline model. (i.e. α-synuclein increases to 0,22 at disease model).

For the sake of simulation, data from both models (disease and baseline) was merged. Subsequently, the disease model was divided by the baseline model and percentage format was applied.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plot was generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the baseline model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
