The upper panel shows the time course of concentration of alpha for the chaotic regime as in upper panel of fig 3B, the lower panel a bifurcation diagram of alpha against ks similar to the upper panel of fig 1 of the reference publication. The time course was calculated using Copasi v 4.6.33, the bifurcation diagram using the Oscill8 v 2.0.11 and SBW 2.7.10. In the bifurcation diagram thick lines indicate stable, thin instable solutions. The orange line stands for the steady state of alpha, the purple line for its maximal value in oscillations.
