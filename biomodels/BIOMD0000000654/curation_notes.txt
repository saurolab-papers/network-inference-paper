Figures 3 C of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the mutated Ras condition (Purple line). The blue line and black line corresponds to the simulation data from normal condition model (BIOMD0000000648) in the presence (W=1) and absence (W=0) of Wnt. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
