a) Figure 3B (DNA damage, p53 S15 and
 p21 (CDKN1A)) and b)Figure S17
are reproduced here. Figure 3B in the
paper is the mean+sd of the plot obtained
from  500 stochastic simulation runs.
Figure S17 is the stochastic simulation of 6
randomly selected cells. But, the curation
figure is obtained using deterministic simulation
run using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32). This is why the  curation figure and corresponding figures in the paper do not look alike.
