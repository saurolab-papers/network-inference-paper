The model reproduces figure 4 of the reference publication and was simulated using SBML Simulator. The SBML Simulator generates the results in mol. In order to get the concentration plot (i.e. as mol/L), the values are divided by the compartment volume 3.41L (Volume of venous blood). Also, note that in the paper (Figure 4) the concentration of Venous APAP is microMol/mL, whereas in the model it is Mol/L.
