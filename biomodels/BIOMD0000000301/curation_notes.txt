Reproduction of fig S5 in the supplement of the reference publication. The simulation was performed with Copasi 4.6. The curves display the pGFP concentration at each time point minus the steady state concentration of pGFP. To simulate to pulses the length of the third pulse was set to -1. The values for the  pulses were:
pulse1_start = 0.01, pulse_interval = 20
three pulses: pulse1_length = pulse2_length = 11, pulse3_length = 22
two pulses: pulse1_length = pulse2_length = 22, pulse3_length = -1
