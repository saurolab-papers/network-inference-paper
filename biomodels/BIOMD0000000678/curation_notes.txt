Reproduced figures of figures 3B and 3C of the reference publication. Time courses of dephosphorylated NFAT (black) and translocated NFAT (red) are shown for a constant stimulation until t=40 min (figure 3B) and for high and low frequency stimulations (figure 3C). Simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
