Figures 6, 7 and 8 of the reference publication have been reproduced. 

The model illustrates three distinct behaviours of CML cell count over time. Although the overall trend is similar between the reference and reproduced figure, CML cell count in the reproduced figures are slightly offset. To match the reference figure, parameters such as d_c, Cmax, etc. reported in the reference publications need to be adjusted.

Simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) using parameter values in Table 3 in the reference paper and figures were produced in Matlab R2014b.
