Figure 3A from the reference manuscript was reproduced in COPASI 4.33.246.
The initial conditions infected_tumor_cells = 0.01, uninfected_tumor_cells = 0.0001, virus-specific_CTLs = 0 and modified parameter sets (see below) were used to simulate plots similar to Fig. 3A in the manuscript.
For Fig. 3A non-cytotoxic virus, k = 17 and beta= 0.5.
For Fig. 3A cytotoxic virus, beta = 0.5.
