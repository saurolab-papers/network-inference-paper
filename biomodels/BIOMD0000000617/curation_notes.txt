The model was encoded and simulated using Copasi 4.15. Wolfram Mathematica 8 and MS PowerPoint were used to process the figures. The left graph of figure 2C from the paper was simulated. The different curves represent the profile of rate v for different values of the substrate S.
 
S = {15,25,61,92,115,250}
