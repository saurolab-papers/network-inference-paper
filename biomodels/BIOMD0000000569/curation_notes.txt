Figure 3B (right) of the reference publication has been reproduced here. Stochastic simulation of a population of 50 receptors for 0.01 seconds. Only the most populated states are represented (and named in the legend) for sake of clarity.

Simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings and Matlab files, found as supplementary material in the publication, can be downloaded from the below links:
