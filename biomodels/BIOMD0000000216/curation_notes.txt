The figure 2C of the reference publication is reproduced. To reproduce figure 2C, the following initial conditions were used (as per the authors suggestion). This is different from that of the model.
M=1.35; CP=0.039; CP2=0.088; TF=0.06; IC=0.44 (TFtot=0.5 & IC=TFtot-TF).
The model was simulation and run using Copasi v4.5
