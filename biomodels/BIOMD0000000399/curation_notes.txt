Figure 1 and S1 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The inconsistency between the y-axis measure of the curation figure and that of the paper is due to the units. In the papers, ERK_PP concentration dynamics is measured in mol/m3 and as the number of molecules. The plot shows the dynamics of ERK_PP for different values of EGF ranging from 0.0625ng/mL to 50ng/mL. In the model, EGF is presented as the number of molecules. EGF=5962molecules correspond to 50ng/mL, 596.2molecules correspond to 5ng/mL, 49.62 correspond to .5ng/mL, 12.405molecules correspond to 0.125ng/mL and 6.2025molecules correspond to 0.0625ng/mL.
The simulated was done using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).
