Figure 5 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The plots shows cannabinoid receptor (CB1) occupancy (in percentage) in the brain with the increasing dosage of drug (0.1 to 40mg). The model as such reproduces the plot corresponding to 10mg dose. Other plots were obtained by varying the value of the parameter "Dose".

The model was simulated using Copasi V4.11 (Build 64). The plots was generated using Gnuplot.
