I tried to reproduce figure 4 under the condition of low-dose and short-interval using the COPASI file and COPASI, by setting time=2500. The figure is exact for equilibrium state. However the conditions with drug are not exact. Please edit the drug intake using 'events'.

Respond from the Author about drug:
We described the doses and interval schedules in the "Methods ยง 2.3. Dose schedules for Rapamycin". To elaborate, after I developed the model based on the extracted rate constants, I ran the model and reach the previously mentioned steady-state concentrations for all the species in the absence of Rapamycin. Then, to start for finding a starting point for our Rapamycin doses, I converted the 15 ng/ml concentration of Rapamycin (the whole-blood concentration of rapamycin in transplant patients) to almost 8.0 * 10^-20 mole of rapamycin is present in every 5.0 * 10^-12 liter of their blood.
I ran the simulations with these numbers and found out that it has a moderate effect on the concentrations of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, I named 8.0*10^-20 moles of rapamycin the "low dose".
As we wanted to show that how the dose AND interval of rapamycin affects the dynamics of the core components of mTOR complexes, and with a little inspiration from Mannick et al. 2014 study, I chose two intervals for our study: Daily (short interval) and weekly (long interval). Hence, low dose and short interval is 8.0E-20 mole/day.
To have a weekly interval with the same cumulative dose as the "low dose short interval" we can multiply 8.0E-20 mole by 7 = 5.6E-19 moles but administer it weekly.
Now, 5.6E-19 mole is the high dose. We can administer this high dose weekly (schedule III) or daily (schedule II). Now, with another inspiration from Mannick's work, the VERY high dose is 4 times greater than the high dose = 2.24E-18 moles and we administered it only as a weekly scheduled dose.
