We used COPASI 4.19 (Build 140) to reproduce figure 14 d from the paper. The simulation was run on COPASI and the plot was generated using R.

The authors in the original paper have used COPASI to calculate the steady state values. These values were then used on SigmaPlot and a 3-parameter sigmoidal curve f = min + (max-min)/(1+10^(logEC50-x)) was used in  generating this figure.
