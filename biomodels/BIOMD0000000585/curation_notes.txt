There are four variants of this model, basically for two different cell lines with two different experimental conditions. This model correspond to the Interferon-gamma induced STAT1 signalling in the pancreatic cancer cell (IFNgamma=100ng/ml). The first row of figure S2 in the supplementary material of the paper is reproduced here. The model was integrated using Copasi v4.15 (Build 95) and the plots were generated using gnuplot.
Note: In addition, the four variants of the model and its associated SEDML files can obtained from the link below.
Note: The parameters k_v, k_0 and k_2 are omitted from the original model as k_v has the value 1 and k_0 and k_2 have the value 0, which makes them redundant.
