Simulations were performed using Copasi 4.5 (build 30). The different initial conditions were taken from the matlab files included in the supplementary materials of the article. For the upregulated Bcl-2 the initial number of mitochondrial Bcl-2 proteins was multiplied by 12 resulting in 240000. To model addition of XIAP siRNA its initial amount was multiplied by a factor 0.13 giving 13000.
