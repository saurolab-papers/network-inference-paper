Similar figures of figure 1 of the reference publication have been produced. Raw ADAS-cog scores have been plotted for varied CeA (CI-1017) concentration using a linear (top left), hyperbolic (top right) and signmoidal (bottom left) response model. Simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated with MATLAB R2014. Different response models can be implemented by changing the quantity 'MODEL_TYPE' from 0 to 4 with 0=Inactive, 1=Linear, 2=Hyperbolic, 3=Sigmoidal, 4=U-Shaped. Simulations were performed using a parameter scan varying the initial value of CeA from 0 to 75 in increments of 1 with the parameter scan task set to 'time course' and plot type set to 'points'.
