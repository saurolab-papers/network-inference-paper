This model corresponds to the PTH response to Hypercalcemia model, described in the reference publication. The model as such has the parameter values that correspond to Subject 1 and reproduces Figure 13 & 16 (Figure "a) Subject 1" in here) of the reference publication. Figure 14 & 17 (Figure "b) Subject 2" in here) and Figure 15 & 18 (Figure "c) Subject 3" in here) of the reference publication are also reproduced by changing the values of the parameters lambda_1, lambda_2, m1, m2, R, beta, x1_n, x2_n, x2_min, x2_max, Ca0, Ca1, t0 and alpha (see the model header or the publication for details about the parameter values). The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32).
