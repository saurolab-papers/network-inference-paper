Figure 1C of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The parameters defined are in minutes.
So, to get simulation result for 8hours, the model should be run for 480mins (8x60).

The model as such reproduces the plot corresponding to "Sustained TGF-? stimulation (blue plot).

In order to obtain the plot corresponding to "Single pulse of 30 s TGF-? stimulation (red plot),
the following changes are to be made in the model.
1) set "stimulation_type=2" instead of "1".
2) set the Trigger Expression as "Time > single_pulse_duration and stimulation_type = 2".

The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32). The curation figure was generated using Gnuplot, data being obtained from Copasi.
