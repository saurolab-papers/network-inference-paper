Figures 5 F of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the mutated Ras condition (brown line). The black line corresponds to the simulation data in the  absence of Wnt (W=0) from normal condition model (BIOMD0000000648).  The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
