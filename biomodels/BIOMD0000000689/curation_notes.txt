Attempt at reproducing figure 7A of the reference publication. The value of the reaction rate constant for PanB was 0.0121 and not 0.00121 as stated in the supplementary material table 3. Additionally, to get dihydropteroate and dihydrofolate to be approximately the same (yellow and magenta curves, bottom curated figure) as in the publication figure, the reaction rate constant for FolC was decreased from 6184 to 3600. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated with MATLAB R2014b.
