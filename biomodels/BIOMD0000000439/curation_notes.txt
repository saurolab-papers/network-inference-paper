Figure 6c of the reference publication is reproduced. The curation figure is not consistent with that obtained in the paper. This inconsistency is due to way they were generated. 

In the paper, for each concentration, a single value was obtained from the integral of the trajectory of species z3 from time=0 to 30. This means, a single value that represents the area under the curve was obtained by transferring and integrating the simulation data to MATLAB. The plots were then drawn by connecting the points (and smoothed lines) using GraphPad Prism.

The curation figure is obtained by doing a parameter scan for RGS against z3, with twelve different concentrations of ligand. The data were obtained by simulating the model using Copsai v4.8 (Build 35). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
