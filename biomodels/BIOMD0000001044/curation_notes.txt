Figure 8A is reproduced from the literature. Model encoded and simulated using COPASI 4.34(Build251). In the simulated/reproduced figure, x-axis seems to differ from the figure 8a. The authors (Dr.Tyosn) has been contacted for the same and got the explanation. In the manuscript, each time unit is measured and normalized as 0.1h (=6 mins). So the total time tine for 2 cell cyle as literature figure is ~30 hrs which is 30/0.1=300 which matches with the reproduced figure.
