Figure 2B of the reference publication is reproduced here. To obtain the figure, set kDegRnp and kSynP to zero. Note that, the model has time units in hrs and in the plot it is 120 mins. So, the model simulation has to be run for 2 hrs (=120mins). 
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55) and the plots were obtained using Gnuplot.
