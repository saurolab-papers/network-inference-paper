The model reproduces figure S2 of the Supplementary material of the reference publication. In the paper, figure S2 is generated by picking 3 stochastic simulation runs and plotted the monomer, oligomers and inclusion bodies. There is slight inconsistency between the plots obtained here (curation figure) and that of the paper (figure S2). The curation figure is obtained using deterministic simulation run, whereas in the paper figure S2 is obtained using stochastic simulation run.  The inconsistency is due to the difference in the stochastic and deterministic simulation runs. This has been checked with the author.
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32).
