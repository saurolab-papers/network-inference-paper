To be able to reproduce a similar simulation for figure 7B, The initial value of the Rb was changed into 55uM rather than 0.55uM, Also the base serum pulse was changed into 0 
However, the reproduced figure is not an exact replica of the 7B figure mentioned in the paper, the value of the y-axis doesn't fit ( much lower in the model)- as its been explained by the authors- because the model puts out cyclin E concentration which it has re-scaled to Cdk activity.
