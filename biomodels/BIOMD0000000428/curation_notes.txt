As there are no figures that correspond to this fixed-parameter model, the steady state concentrations of four metabolites are highlighted in the table. Figure 5 of the paper shows the distribution of the steady-state concentrations of these four metabolites, where the vertical black line in the plots indicate the value for the fixed-parameter model (highlighted in the table here).

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35).
