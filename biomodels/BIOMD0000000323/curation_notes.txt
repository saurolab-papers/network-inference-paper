This model (MODEL1012090001) corresponds to the Simple model of the three-switch ring oscillator (Design III) described in the paper. The model reproduces figure 6 (central figures) of the reference publication. The time is rescaled by s=v_d/K_I*t where K_I=0.333 and v_d=1 (for alpha = 1) and v_d=0.5 (for alpha = 0.5). i.e. For alpha = 1, s = 0.003 * t (roughly 10 unitless time = 1hr; the time-course should be run for 60 timeunits (6hrs) to get figure 6a). For alpha = 2, s= 0.0015 * t (roughly 5 unitless time = 1hr; the time-course should be run for 100 timesunits (20hrs) to get figure 6b).
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32). The curation figures were generated using Gnuplot by obtained the plot data from Copasi.
