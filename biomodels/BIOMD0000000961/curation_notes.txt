This is an implementation of McDougal's model from 2017 describing (primarily) anaerobic metabolism in cardiomyocytes at the transition to ischemia. The original model was implemented in CellDesigner and converted to Copasi.

This model was curated in COPASI 4.29 (Build 228) and reproducibility was verified by importing and simulating the SBML L2V4 version of the model in VCell 7.2.0 (Build 39). To avoid "divide by zero" errors, all initial values for species which were zero were set to 1e-12. Fig 3A and 3B are reproduced here.
