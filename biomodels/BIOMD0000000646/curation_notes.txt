Figure 2c from the reference publication has been reproduced. The model reproduces the deterministic simulation of the mathematical model of the G1/S control network. Time courses of model components are shown relative to the G1/s transition. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
