The parameter scan for Caspase-3 and NF-kB with TNF ranging from 0.01ng/ml to 100ng/ml is shown in figure 3A of the reference published, and this has been reproduced  here. The units in the model are in microMolar. So, the parameter scan was done with TNF ranging from 3.90625e-07microMolar (=0.01ng/ml) to 0.00390625microMolar (=100ng/ml). The plot shows the parameter scan done for 4 different values of TNF (0.0002, 0.00130234, 0.0026043 and 00390625).The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).
