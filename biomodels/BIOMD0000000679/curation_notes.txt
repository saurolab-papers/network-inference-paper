Figure 2 (top and middle rows) of the reference publication illustrating inflammatory (curated top row) and repair (curated bottom row) macrophage dynamics has been curated. The time scale used in the curated, diabetic wound healing simulation (right) is twice as long as in the reference publication. A parameter scan with one interval can change the value of alpha from 0.5 (normal) to 0.8 (diabetic). The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
