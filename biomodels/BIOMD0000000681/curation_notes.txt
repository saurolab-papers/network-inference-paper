A similar figure of figure 4 of the reference publication illustrating total macrophage density dynamics has been produced. The time scale used in the curated simulation is twice as long as in the reference publication and the value of alpha was changed at t=22 instead of t=10. A parameter scan with one interval can change the value of the dummy_variable from zero to one, which will then either keep alpha constant (untreated, black curve) or change alpha to 0.2 (treated, red curve). The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
