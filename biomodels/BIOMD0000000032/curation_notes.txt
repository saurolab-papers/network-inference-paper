The figures 3 and 6 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. Note that the units are in nanoMolar, whereas the plots in the publications are in microMolar. The model has all the parameters that relates to the wildtype. So, the plots that are reproduced here, denote the wildtype. To get the plots for the mutant variants, change the necessary parameters mentioned in Table 5 of the reference publication and simulate the model. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32).
