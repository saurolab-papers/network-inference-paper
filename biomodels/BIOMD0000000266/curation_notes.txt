Table of steady state concentrations and fluxes of the model with and without heat shock. The calculations were performed using Copasi.
The article does not give much quantitative data for the behavior under heat shock, the approximate fold changes of steady state concentrations can be found in section 5.2.1. "Biochemical consequences of heat shock" of the article.
