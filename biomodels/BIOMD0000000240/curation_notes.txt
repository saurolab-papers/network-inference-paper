Figure 7A and 7B is reproduced here. We got the following useful information for curation from the authors. In the paper, the x-axis is mislabelled by a factor of 5, and also the values for 3 of the parameters are incorrect in the paper. The parameters and their correct values are 1) Kdim (K1 for aprE, in the paper)= 12, 2) kphos (kph, in the paper) = 0.004, and 3) kdephos (kdeph, in the paper) = 0.15. 
All these are implemented in the model. The model was simulated and integrated using Copasi
