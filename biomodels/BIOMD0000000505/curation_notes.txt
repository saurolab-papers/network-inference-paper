The plots in Figures 3a and 3b of the reference paper that corresponds to the standard model is reproduced here. The steady-state flux (vacesink) and concentration of certain entities (CoAMAT and FreeCoA) through variable substrate (Palmityl CoA (C16AcylCoACYT)) concentration from 0 to 200 microM is plotted here. FreeCoA is [CoAMATt]-[CoAMAT].

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64). The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
