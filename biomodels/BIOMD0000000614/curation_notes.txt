Simulations were performed in Copasi while encoding the model and later in Wolfram Mathematica 8 to produce the figure. MS PowerPoint was used to process the simulated figures. The different curves were obtained by changing few parameter values in the equation. Copasi files for each curve can be found in the 'Additional Files' section.
