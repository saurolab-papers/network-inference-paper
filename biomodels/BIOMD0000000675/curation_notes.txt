Similar figures to figure 3 in the reference publication have been produced. Simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated in MATLAB R2014. The curated curves are similar to the curves in the reference publication for approximately t > 12. One discrepancy is that the curve for BUD (middle, green) in the curated simulation has decreased to less than 2 for 125 < t < 160, whereas in the reference publication figure it appears to remain greater than 2 for this time and the curve is not visible. The vertical lines for BUD and ORI (yellow) in the curated figure (middle) is the result of setting these variables to zero when the cell divides, as explained in table 2 of the reference publication.
