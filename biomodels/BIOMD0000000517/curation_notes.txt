Figures 2b and 2c of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The effect of varying cell cycle time (r1) upon numbers of proliferating cells N1 (transit-amplifying cells) is shown here. In Figure b, r1 ranges from 50 to 100% of its original amount. In Figure c, r ranges from 100 to 200% of its original amount.

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64). The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
