Figure 5B of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The plot varies slightly in terms of the period. This is because in the the paper, the simulation is done for the negative time period, i.e. before the administration of PGF_syn at time=0.
The simulation was done using Copasi v4.8 (Build 55) and the plot was generated using gnuplot.
