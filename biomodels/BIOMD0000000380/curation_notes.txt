The steady state concentration in Figure 18.4 of the reference publication has been reproduced here.
The steady state concentration of the metabolites for 1) heat shock can be obtained by setting “heat=1” and 2) TPS1 mutant can be obtained by setting “heat=0” and by setting “activity=0.01” in the reaction T6P synthase.
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).
