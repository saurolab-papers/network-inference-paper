In order to reproduce any of the simulation plots in the paper, few events were required to be added to the main model. Here, Figure 3A of the paper is reproduced. To obtain this plot two events were added to main model 1) insulin administration for 15 mins at the start of the simulation (i.e. 0<=t<=15) and 2) insulin administration for 15 mins at the end of the simulation (i.e. 2785<=t<=2800). The model with these events added to the main model can be downloaded (see below).
The simulation result (data) was obtained by simulating the model using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot.
