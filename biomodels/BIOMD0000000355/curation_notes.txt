There are two models described in the paper to simulate basal and receptor stimulated Ca2+ signaling. 1) No adaptive feedback (MODEL1108050000) and 2) with three slow adaptive feedback loops (this model: MODEL1108050001).
Figure 1B (which shows the simulation of cytosolic Calcium (CaI) at different levels of receptor activation) of the reference article has been reproduced here. The corresponding R value for 15%, 27%, 42% and 75% are 0.39286, 0.70714, 1.1 and 1.96428 respectively, the maximum R value being 2.61905.
The model has also been tested for a range of R values 0-100%, and the results were consistent with that of figure 1C (Control).  For the R range 1) between 0% and 22.5% there was no signal, 2) between 22.5% and 49% triggered Calicum oscillations and 3) between 49% and 100% induced the plateau phase.
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34). Data were obtained from Copasi and plotted using Gnuplot.
