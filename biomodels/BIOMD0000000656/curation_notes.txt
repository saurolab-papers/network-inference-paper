Figures 4 F of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the EGFR over expression (Purple line). The blue line and black line corresponds to the simulation data rom normal condition model (BIOMD0000000648) in presence (W=1) and absence (W=0) of Wnt, respectively.  The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
