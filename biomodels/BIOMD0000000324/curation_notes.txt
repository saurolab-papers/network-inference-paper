Time courses calculated with CopasiUI v4.6.33 as in figure 6 of the publication.
As there is no applied current given, I=50 uA/cm2 was taken. gCA and gK where taken as indicated in the graph.
The other parameter values used where: gL = 2, VL = - 50, VCa = 100, VK = -70, lambdaM_bar = 1 -0, lambdaN_bar = 0.1, V1 = 0, V2 = 15, V3 = 10, V4 = 10, C = 20.  The legend of the two curves in figure 6 seems to be mixed up in respect to the values of gCA and gK used.
