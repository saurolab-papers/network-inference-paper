The paper has multi-cellular, two-cell and single-cell model that describes vascular patterning in Arabidopsis roots. This model correspond to single-cell model. There is no corresponding plot in the paper for this single-cell model. Here, the plot that is generated using the python script sent by the author for single-cell model is reproduced by simulating the model in Copasi v4.12 (Build 72). The plot was obtained using Gnuplot.

The python scripts corresponding to the two-cell and multicellular model can be downloaded from the links below.
