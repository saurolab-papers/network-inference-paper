The paper describes two models of EGFR signalling in normal (MODEL1304020000) and NSCLC (this model - MODEL1304020001) cells.  Figure 4 of the reference publication is reproduced, where plot in red (NSCLC) can be obtained from this model (MODEL1304020001) and the plot in blue (normal cells) was obtained from MODEL1304020000.
The model was simulated using COPASI v4.8 (Build 35). The plots were obtained using Gnuplot.
