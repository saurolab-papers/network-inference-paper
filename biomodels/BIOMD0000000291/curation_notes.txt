The model reproduces figure 2a and 2b of the reference publication. The parameter values in Table 1 are in Molar. They are converted mMolar to reproduce the plots.
This model corresponds to n=1 (i.e.The number of sites on the Carbon pyropolymer, that are occupied by 1 albumin molecule is 1). The initial concentrations of albumin and bilirubin are 0.461539mM and 0.175439mM respectively. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32)
