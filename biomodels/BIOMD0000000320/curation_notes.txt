Time courses for a dose of 80/20mg/kg L-Dopa/Benserazide as in figures 5 and 7 of the original article. The results were calculated using Copasi 4.6.33.
Due to problems with the use of initial assignments in Copasi, the model has to be evaluated once using either a short time-course simulation or a steady state computation to calculate and assign the correct starting values. After this, the model reproduces the correct results. Future versions of Copasi should not have this problem. The model was also tested with SBW 2.7.10, which did not exhibit this problem.
