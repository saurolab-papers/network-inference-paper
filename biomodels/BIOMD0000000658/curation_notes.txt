Figure 6 of the publication has been reproduced. The initial conditions were given in table 2 for all species except GSK3 and APC/axin which were set to 50 and 0.01 respectively. The reverse reaction rate constants (k_7, k_8, k_16, k_17) for reactions v7, v8, v16 and v17 were defined as k_x = kx*Kx where kx is the forward reaction rate constant and Kx is the relative dissociation constant. k7, k8, k16 and k17 were set to 500. This model is without the regulatory loop, meaning reactions v11, v13 and v15 are not dependent on APC and follow mass action kinetics and not Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as explained in the supplementary files. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
