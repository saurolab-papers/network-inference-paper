Figure 6c and 7c  are reproduced (trends and y axis level) exactly as per literature (using Global quantity "alpha"= 0.0000631, "gamma" = 333 for figure 6a/6c and using Global quantity "alpha"= 10, "gamma" = 574 for figure 7a/7c). 
Figure 6a and 7a is matching in terms of trend but y axis level are slightly different from published literature.
