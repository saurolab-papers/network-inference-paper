The curated model produces similar results for figures 4A, 4B and 4C of the reference publication. The figures illustrate target cell (black curve corresponding to left axis) and cytotoxic T-lymphocye (blue curve corresponding to right axis) dynamics for: r=0.13, low initial C (4A) ; r=1.0, increased C (4B) and r=1.0, low C (4C). The model is very sensitive to initial conditions. 4A: T(0) = 0.1, A(0)=0.1. A*(0) = 0.1, C(0)=0.01. 4B: T(0) = 0.1, A(0)=2. A*(0) = 2, C(0)=0.01. 4A: T(0) = 0.1, A(0)=2. A*(0) = 2, C(0)=0.3.
