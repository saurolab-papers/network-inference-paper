Figure 2A of the reference publication has been reproduced here, as two-dimensional plots whereas it is representation as a three-dimensional plot in the paper. 

Left: Simulation of Amyloid aggregation growth (X) with 1 mM chemical concentration for 20 hours time period.
Right: Simulation of Amyloid aggregation growth (X) depending on varying concentrations of the inhibitor (C).

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from below link
