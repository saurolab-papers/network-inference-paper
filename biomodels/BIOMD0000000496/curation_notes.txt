The paper describes two kinetic models of yeast metabolic network with (MODEL1307040000) and without (MODEL1204270000) regulation. This model corresponds to the standard model without regulation. Figure B in the supplementary material of the paper is reproduced here. The plot coloured blue corresponds to this model (i.e. MODEL1204270000) and green corresponds to regulation model (MODEL1307040000).

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
