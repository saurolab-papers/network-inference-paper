As the model uses events to simulate the medium changes, a solver supporting these is required. Alternatively the simulations can be performed piecewise until the time points of growth medium changes and continuing after manual changes of the concentrations of GLC, ACT and BM. With Copasi this can be done using the "update model" option under time course.
