Figure 3 of the reference publication has been reproduced. Initial conditions and values were taken from the publication. Value for beta3 and rho was not stated in the paper, and through trial and error the values were estimated as 0.1 and 20 respectively. The model was simulated using Copasi 4.24 and the figure was generated using Python 3.7.
