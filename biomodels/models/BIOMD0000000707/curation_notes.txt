Figure 2b of the reference publication has been reproduced. Simulation of the model with double infection. Infection rates are set to be equal. ie alpha=beta . Initial conditions are x(0)=3, y(0)=6, v(0)=149 and w(0)=1. The model was simulated using Copasi 4.22 and the figure was generated using Python 2.7.
