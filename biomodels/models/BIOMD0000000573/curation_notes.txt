Figure 2 of the reference publication has been reproduced here: deterministic simulations of concentration for 50 hours using two different initial conditions. For the upper curve V(0) = 5 and C(0) = 0, for the lower curve V(0) = 0 and C(0) = 0.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plot was generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
