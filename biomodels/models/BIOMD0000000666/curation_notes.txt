Figure 4A of the reference publication has been reproduced. The red, green and blue lines represent ErkActive, bRafMutated (left axis) and Dabrafenib (right axis) concentrations respectively. The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to Dabrafenib dosage 1.25e-10. To obtain simulations for different dosages change the initial value of Dabrafenib. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b. The model is unstable for small times, therefore the data plotted is from 70 seconds and above of the time course.
