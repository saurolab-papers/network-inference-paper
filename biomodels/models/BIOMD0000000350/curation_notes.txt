Figure 2 of the reference publication has been reproduced. The plots can be obtained by setting rep_X (X=CCA1, TOC1, pCCA1, or pTOC1) parameters to "1". All these four parameters equals "0", denote the non-reporter core of the system. 
The y-axis of the curation figure is not consistent with that of the reference publication. This is because, in the paper the simulated data has been rescaled (multiplied by an aribitrary factor) to fit the experimental data.
Simulation was done using RoadRunner online simulator (http://www.sys-bio.org/Simulation2005/Default.aspx?step=0). Data were obtained from RoadRunner simulator and plotted using Gnuplot.
