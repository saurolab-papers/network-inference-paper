The figures that have been reproduced from the curated model  
we had to change the parameter ( a ) from 0.000001 into 0.001 to be able to reproduce the figures. 
Figure 1 represent patients 2 and 8 in a constant ( b=0) and non-constant rate parameter ( b = 0.00003)
Figure 3 represent the Tumour Doubling time of the model ( DB) and the Tumour doubling time for each patient ( DT_P(1-7))
