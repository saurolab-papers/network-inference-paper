Model is encoded using COPASI 4.24 (Build197) and plots are generated using R ggplot package. Model simulation time is 20 hour. Figure 2 and Figure 4 of the published model has been reproduced. Although Figures are not exact but similar.

The submitted xml file had difference in the equation for formation of LHRH compared to the one present in the paper (Refer to equation no 26 in paper). With the data provided in the paper similar to figure 2 and figure 4 were reproduced but not exact. The patterns were similar.

Although using the equation (Refer to equation 26 in paper) provided in the paper, the figure was not reproducible.
