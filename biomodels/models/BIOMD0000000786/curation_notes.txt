Model is created and data generated using COPASI 4,24 (build 197). Model is pre-simulated for 101 hours (363600 seconds) before triggering the system with TNF. Model is simulated for 6 hours post TNF stimulation (385200 seconds). Data presented include last 1 hours of pre-TNF stimulation + 6 hours of post TNF stimulation. Attached Copasi file will reproduce literature figure 3b, 3h, 3i, 3j by default.
