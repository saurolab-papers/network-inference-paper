Figure 1C of the reference publication has been reproduced here. Concentration dynamics of misfolded ?-synuclein (?SN) and Reactive Oxygen Spices (ROS) are plotted over 200 days. 
Stress of 2.6 obtained by optimization (parameter S1) was imposed between days 10 and 150 in order to reproduce the Figure.

Reactions, parameters, rate equations and differential equations are found in Figure 1 and Table 1. 

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
