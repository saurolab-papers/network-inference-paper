The reproduces figure 1 of the reference publication.The bifurcation analysis was performed using the AUTO2000 front end and SBW 2.7.10. Both branches were calculated independently, the off state with X[t=0]=1 and the on state with X[t=0]=4. Continuation was performed from S=0 to 2 in negative direction.
