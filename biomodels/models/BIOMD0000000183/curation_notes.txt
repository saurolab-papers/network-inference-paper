Reproduction of some of the results from figure 4 of the original publication. The results correspond to the figure in the corrigendum. All simulations were performed using SBML ODESolver using a PPB2 concentration of 0 M, a CamKII concentration of 7e-05 M resp. 0 M. The starting values for CamR and CamT were 9.7e-12 M resp. 2e-07 M. The integration was performed for 100 sec or until a steady state was reached.
