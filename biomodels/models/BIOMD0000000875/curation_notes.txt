The model has been encoded in COPASI 4.24 (Build 197) and the Figure 2 of the publication has been generated. The value of np was 0.05 for the right and 0.08 for the left one. 
The figures are very much similar to the publication although the left one is a bit high at the end in the publication but our simulated model did not show that.
