Figures 1C (pcd/pcd mice and nr/nr mice models) and 2A (Rom1-/- mice model) have been reproduced here. Evolution of outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness during 12 months. 

- pcd/pcd and nr/nr mice models are plotted by using constant risk of cell death, according to the article.
- Rom1-/- mice mode is plotted by using exponentially decreasing risk of cell death, according to the supplementary information.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link.
