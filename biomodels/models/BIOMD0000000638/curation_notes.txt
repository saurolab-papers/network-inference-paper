We reproduce the Gbg/Gtot lines for Rtot values of 330, 3300 and 33000 as shown in figure EV3B. We used COPASI (4.19, Build 140) to generate this figure. We tried to reproduce figure EV3B using other tools, but were unable to do so. Plot data was generated using COPASI and the plots were created using Matlab.

We believe that the model is correct and for now, attach the COPASI files reproducing this figure.
