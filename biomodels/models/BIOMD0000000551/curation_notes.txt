Notes:

Figure 4 of the reference publication has been reproduced here In this model some parameters are missing. Optimization is done in order to fit the figure. See values:

- Deltap = 0.55
- K1 = 1.13
- r = 0.43

Dynamics of A? in CSF and plasma with a dose of 120 mpk of gamma-secretase inhibitor are plotted during 72 hours.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plos were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model wih simulation setings can be downloaded from the below link:
