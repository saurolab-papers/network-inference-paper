Simulations were performed under three different conditions: 
1) normal condition (no stress), 
2) moderate stress due to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) i.e. ROS levels were increased by a factor of 4 at time=4hours for a period of 1 hour (not 2 hours as mentioned in the figure 5 legend of the reference publication. This is, a typo in the paper and is clarified by the author) [Refer supporting file: MODEL1005280000_moderatestress.xml]  and 
3) high stress due to sustained increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (here ROS increases with time) [Refer supporting file:MODEL1005280000_highstress.xml].

Supplementary figures S3 (normal condition), S4 (moderate stress condition) and S6 (high stress condition) are reproduced here.

SBML odeSolver was used for model simulation and plots were generated using gnuplot.
