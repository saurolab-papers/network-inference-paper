The model as such, when simulated in COPASI, produces the exact simulation results as shown by the blue curves (2.5 model) in Figure 3 of the publication. Since the publication simulations were performed in COPASI, the curated figure illustrates the simulation results obtained with SBMLsimulator 1.2.1 using the Runge Kutta Event Solver and an interval size of 0.1. The simulation data was imported into and plotted with MATLAB R2104b. The same general behaviour is observed; the only discrepancy is that the values are slightly underestimated.
