Reproduction of the figures 2 b) and c) and figure 3 of the original article.
Figures a) and b) show simple time-courses with different initial concentrations for STU - 5 in a) and 20 in b). The initial concentrations of all other dependent metabolites were set to 0. Calculations were performed using SBW 2.8.1
Figure c) is a bifurcation diagram calculated with the Auto2000 tool of SBW  (see http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/2009/02/simplifying-bifurcation-analysis.html), with the initial concentrations for STU set to 20 and to 10 for all other dependent metabolites.
