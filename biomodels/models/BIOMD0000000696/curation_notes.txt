A similar figure to figure 5B of the publication was reproduced. Parameter values from cluster 1 (table 4) were used. The curated figure shows simulation results from a parameter scan that used 2 intervals to change gamma_1 from 79 to 200 and k_mC*C_gC from 1 to 171. The sensitivity measure (J1) was also recorded and plotted as figure 5A. Low sensitivity scores (1e-1) correspond to the large peaks in protein c concentration (3e4) while higher sensitivity scores (1e1) correspond to low peaks (1e2) that are not visible in figure 5B. Using parameter values that result in lower sensitivity scores (1e-2) is likely to result in higher protein c peaks (5e4) as reported in the publication. 

Initial parameter values for k_mA*C_ga, k_pC, d_B, d_C, gamma_1, gamma_3, gamma_4 and gamma_5 were set to values found in the original encoded model. Parameter k_mC*C_gC was set to 1. 

The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
