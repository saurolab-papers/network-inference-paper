This model (MODEL1012090000) corresponds to the Simple model for both mode I and II (Design I and II) described in the paper. The model reproduces timecourse figure plotted in the supplementary material (page 10 of Supplementary material) of the reference publication.
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32). Curation figure was generated using Gnuplot by obtaining the plot data from Copasi.
