Figure 5d of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model as such can reproduce the lower panel of figure 5d. The plot in the upper panel, can be obtained by changing the parameter "Ephos" to 40000J/mol (40kJ/mol).
The model was simulated using SBMLsimulator 1.0. The data were obtained and plotted using gnuplot.
