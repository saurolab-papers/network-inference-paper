Figure s19 in the supplementary material of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model as such corresponds to the auxin dose of 10nM (cyan line in the plot). Different auxin doses are incorporated in the model using the parameter, qj_star.
qj_star = 1.00 (no auxin)
qj_star = 0.68 (1nM)
qj_star = 0.23 (5nM)
qj_star = 0.16 (10nM)
qj_star = 0.05 (100nM)
qj_star = 0.03(1000nM).

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35).
