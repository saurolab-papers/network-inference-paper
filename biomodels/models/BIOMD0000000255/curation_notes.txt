Reproduction of the figure S3 from the supplemental material of the original article. The time courses of ErbB1_P are only qualitatively correct, as the scaling factors were not known.

On the lower time axis the model time including the equilibration phase (8000s) is shown, on the upper one the time after stimulation in minutes.

The time-courses were simulated using sbml odesolver.
