Figure 6 of the publication has been reproduced. Model, initial conditions and parameter values were obtained from ModelDB. Values for d(0) and o(0) could not be found and were set to 0.1. Cm was set to 0.009uF (not 9 nF as in table 1, simulation units are uF). I_Ca equation is supposedly meant to be changed from gca*d^2 to gca*(d^2)*(Vm-ECa) (CellML) however the figure was reproduced using the original equations from ModelDB. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated with MATLAB R2014b.
