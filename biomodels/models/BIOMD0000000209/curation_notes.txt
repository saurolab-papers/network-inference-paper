The model reproduces the Figure 5-right (Figure (B) here) and Figure 4 (Figure (A) here) of the reference publication. The model was simulated using Copasi v.4.4. Figure A) represents the time series concentration of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, GATA6, CDX2 and GCNF for the three regimes (in terms of the concentration levels of signal A), indicating the final steady state values. To plot the time series against the concentrations the parameters q3, e3 and f4 were set to zero. The concentration of signal A used for the four states are i) A=1 for Trophectoderm, ii) A=10 for Stem Cell and Differentiated Stem Cell and iii) A=25 for Endoderm. The initial concentration of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG is 5, and of CDX2, GATA6 and GCNF is 0 for Trophectoderm, Stem Cell and Endoderm. The initial concentration of OCT4,SOX2 and NANOG is 0, and of CDX2, GATA6 and GCNF is 5 for Differentiated Stem Cell. Figure B) represents the steady state concentration of OCT4, NANOG and GATA6 as functions of the external signal SN that induces NANOG (Figure 5 (right) of the paper. The concentration of signal A used is 25.
