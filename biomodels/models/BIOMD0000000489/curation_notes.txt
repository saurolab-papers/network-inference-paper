Figures 3 and 4 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model time is in seconds, for 400 mins, the simulation should be run for 24000 secs. Further the concentration are plotted in microMolar units whereas in the paper it is in nanoMolar. 
The simulation was done using SBML odeSolver. The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
