All the parameters of the model corresponds to the resting state. In order to generate the plot that corresponds to different stress conditions (figure 2A of the reference publication), the following parameters were changed for different stress conditions.
Nutlin: kf =500;
DNA Damage: delta=2, gamma=0.5 and kf=2500.
Oncogene: delta=2;
Hypoxia: delta=2, kt=0.01;
