Figure 1 of the corresponding publication is reproduced.

Figure 1 shows a series of simulations (red traces) that are overlaid with each other. Each simulation represents the response to a light stimulus of increasing intensity. The stimulus is controlled by the following parameters:
flashDel = 0.03;flashDur = 0.02;flashMag = 0.731, 2.064, 6.536, 16.942, 53.75, 190.92, 604.58, 1990.9
All three parameters must be set to define the stimulus (a 0.02s-long flash of light that occurs 0.03s after the start of the simulation (to
correctly simulate the original experiment) and that has an intensity
ranging from 0.731 to 1990.9 R*/s). So, flashMag is
the parameter that is varied to produce the series of responses. The output state is deltaJ.

There is a minor issue in the SBML implementation of the model, the systems goes to numerical instability beyond certain values of flashMag (>909.22) with 0.03s delay (flashDel=0.03). So, except for the plot that correspond to flashMag=1990.9, all the other plots are reproduced.

Copasi v4.15 (Build 95) was used for simulation, and gnuplot was used generate the figure.
