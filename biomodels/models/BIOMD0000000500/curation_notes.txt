Figure 5a of the reference publication that correspond to the plots associated with singleGAS (1xGAS) (red in paper) is reproduced here. The model as such reproduces GAS site occupancy for high cooperativity (Kon_P1=60000s-1). To generate the plot for low cooperativity the parameter Kon_P1 should be set to 1000s-1 (refer to page 45 of Supplementary material of the paper). 
Condition used: Parameter scan (logarithmic)- [S1]_0 in range from 1e-11 to 1e-07 for 50 intervals against GAS_siteOccupancy.
The simulation was done using Copasi v4:11 (Build 64). Plots were generated using Gnuplot
