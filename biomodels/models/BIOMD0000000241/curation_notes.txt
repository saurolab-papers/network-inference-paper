Simulation of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) when drinking cups of coffee at different time intervals as in fig. 5 of the original publication. The caffeine content of each cup was 90 mg, the assumed body weight 80 kg. The time courses were computed using SBML ODESolver (options for event detection: --printstep 500 -n)
