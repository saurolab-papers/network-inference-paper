Figure 2 (bottom row) of the reference publication illustrating TGF-B dynamics has been curated. The time scale used in the curated, diabetic wound simulation (bottom) is twice as long as in the reference publication. A parameter scan with one interval can change the value of alpha from 0.5 (normal) to 0.8 (diabetic). The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
