Figures 1 (i) and (ii) of the reference publication were reproduced. The figures illustrate changes in infected (dashed line) and uninfected (solid line) CD4 T-cell population for different initial conditions (v(0) = 0.1 and 1.0 for figures 1 (i) and (ii) respectively). The simulations were performed using COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and plots were generated in Matlab R2014b.
