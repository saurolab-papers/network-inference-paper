The paper has plots that correspond to different UV irradiation dose (5, 10, 50, 75J/m^2, etc.). The condition encoded in this model correspond to a UV irradiation of 5J/m^2, that should reproduce Figure 2B of the paper. Here, Figure 2B of the paper is reproduced. An assignment rule for PCNA_poly (i.e. PCNA_sum - the sum of every species in which PCNA isoforms (included complex) are involved) has been added to model to obtain the figure. The model time is in seconds and So, to run the simulation for 300mins, it has to be run for 18000(300x60) seconds. 
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot.
