The model reproduces Figure 6 of the reference publication after rescaling the data. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.5 (Build 30). The time-course was run using Copasi and the data were obtained. The variables and the time were rescaled according to equation 27 of the paper, to reproduce the figure 6. The plot was done using Gnuplot.
