Treatment involved blue-light therapy every day for the first 28 days. Blue-light therapy was then simulated three times a week up until 84 days. The reproduced figure 5A was more similar to the publication figure if the blue light exposure time was simulated for an entire day (t = 1 day) if there was treatment on that day instead of simulating for the actual time of 30 minutes a day (t = 0.02083 days). 

The top row illustrates the simulation results from the curated model in an attempt to reproduce figure 5A and 5B from the publication with blue light therapy exposure matching that of the treatment description (every day for t <= 28, three times a week for 28 < t < 84). However simulation results were a closer match to the publication figures (bottom row) when exposure to blue light therapy remained unchanged for the entire 84 days (i.e. constant exposure). 

One aspect where the encoded model differs from the publication equations is that the degradation terms for growth arrested, spinous, transit amplifying and stem cells have been multiplied by an epidermal apoptosis index (table 1) for healthy (Al_h) and psoriatic (Al_d) conditions in the encoded model.

The original model was encoded in MATLAB and converted into SBML using MOCCASIN. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated in MATLAB R2014b.
