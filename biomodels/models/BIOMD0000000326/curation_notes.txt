Figures 7D, 7E and 7F of the reference publication has been reproduced here.The plot shows the photoresponses from rods stimulated by flashes of increasing strength (by varying flash0Mag). In order to obtain figure 7, the following parameters need to altered.
Flash intensity: flash0Mag = 1.54, 12.5, 45.8, 184, 800, 2000; other parameters: flashBG = 0; flash0Dur = flashDur = 0.024; flashDel = 0; flashMag = 0;
In addition to the above changes, to obtain 1) figure 7E, set Rec_wCa2_RK(0) = 1.0091e+07; RK(0) = 26011; RKdark = 26011; and 2) figure 7F, set RGS(0) = 6.9e+06.

The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32).
