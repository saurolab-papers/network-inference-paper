Reproduction of figure 3 from the original publication using Copasi 4.6 for deterministic simulation.
For each value of tau, the model was started with the steady state values for a latent infection with strain 1. As described in the article, invasion of strain 2 was simulated by using an initial value of 1e-06/N for strain 2. 
The parameters plotted are:
V : V_frac 
strain 1 : strain1_frac  
strain 2 : strain2_frac
