Reproduction of figure 2b of the original publication, showing the time course of hypoxanthine of the GMA model in response to a PRPP pulse. As mentioned in the article, the concentration of PRPP was increased 10 fold from 5 to 50 microM. There seems to be a typo in the articles figure caption, as the increase of PRPP takes place at t =0 not 10. 

The simulation was performed using Copasi 4.4 b.26.
