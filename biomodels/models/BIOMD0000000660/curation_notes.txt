Supplementary Figure 7a of the reference publication has been reproduced. The model as such reproduces  the deterministic simulation of the mathematical model. Time courses of model components (Cdk2:Cyclin (blue), PCNA (purple), p21 (red) and aRC (green)) are shown relative to the G1/s transition. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
