The model was encoded and simulated using Copasi 4.15. Wolfram Mathematica 8 and MS PowerPoint were used to process the figures. The x-axis is in log-scale. The different curves in the figure are obtained by varying two parameters: upper left (A=1,t1=10), lower left (A=4,t1=90), upper right (A=1,t1=30), lower right (A=4,t1=90).
