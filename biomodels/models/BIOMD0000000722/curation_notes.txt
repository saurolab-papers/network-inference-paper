Figure 10 of the reference publication has been reproduced. Initial conditions and values were taken from the publication. The main xml file attached is for wound healing in normal health conditions. To reproduce the figure, run the simulation with time step size of 0.1 and plot against data from both normal and diabetic wound healing simulations. The model was simulated using Copasi 4.24 and the figure was generated using Python 3.7.
