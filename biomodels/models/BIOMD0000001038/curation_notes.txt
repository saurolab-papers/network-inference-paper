Figure 11 from the reference manuscript, representing the tumor-normal-vitamins model (TNVM) described by the system of equations presented in (10), was reproduced in COPASI 4.33.246.
The values of gamma and beta2 stated in the manuscript were swapped, i.e. gamma = 0.9817 and beta2 = 0.2291, to reproduce Fig. 11.
