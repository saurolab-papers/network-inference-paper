This model contain the equations for one "average cell" with median initial concentrations for CD95, FADD, p55, BID, PrNES_mCherry and PrER_mGFP. Figure 4B in the reference publication gives the simulation and experimental results of several cells (80 different cells). As this model is a "average cell" model, trajectories similar to that of Figure 4B has been reproduced, but for the ligand concentration of 500ng/ml (CD95L = 16.6nM (500ng/ml)). The simulation results are checked with the authors.
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.12 (Build 72). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
