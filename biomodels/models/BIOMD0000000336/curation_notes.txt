Thrombin generation model by Jones & Mann, 1994. Factors are denoted by their roman numberals. Initial concentration of Tissue Factor (TF) was varied from 5pM (as in model file) to values seen in the plot.

Simulation using Copasi (LSODE) and rendering using Matplotlib to reproduce figure 4 of the article.

Note: Va-Xa complex binding uses k6 as in the article ODEs. In the article rate constants table, it should use k8 but that does not reproduce the figure.
