The model reproduces figure 4 of the reference publication. The four plots for "Fus3PP", "Kss1PP", "PREP" and "FREP" displays for the case 1) that only pheromone (alpha; green in the plot) is present, 2) that only a starvation signal (beta; blue in the plot) is present and 3) that both are active (alpha and beta; red in the plot). For the case that have only 
1) pheromone is present, the parameter is set as, alphastim=1 and betastim=0. 2) starvation signal is present, the parameter is set as, alphastim=0 and betastim=1. 3)for both active, alphastim=betastim=1.
The model was simulated and integrated using Copasi v4.5 (Build 30).
