The full model (two submodels that correspond to each Calmodulin lobe are put together) intact calmodulin with targets: The effect of CaMKII (rbp) bound to Calmodulin (blue plot) in Figure 9 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. Figure 9 in the paper refer only to the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin, whereas the model submitted here is a full model. So, to obtain figure 9 of the paper the following changes are to be made.

Effect of CaMKII (rbp) binding to Calmodulin (blue line):
Set concentration of CaM to 40µM (4e-05) and that of CaMKII to 100µM (1e-04)
Set Kd_rbp_RR = Kd_rbp_TR = 0.95 µM (Same affinity for RR and TR = we don't care about the state of the N-lobe)
Set Kd_rbp_RT = Kd_rbp_TT = 88 µM
Set Kd_tbp_TT = Kd_tbp_RT = 43 nM
Set Kd_tbp_RR = Kd_tbp_TR = 1.05 µM

Further,
to plot the effect of neurogranin (tbp) binding to Calmodulin (red line in figure 9 of the paper):
set CaMKII to 0 and Neurogranin (tbp) to 40 µM (4e-05).

to plot the effect of competing targets (purple line in the figure 9 of the paper):
set CaMKII to 100µM (1e-04) and Neurogranin (tbp) to 40 µM (4e-05).
