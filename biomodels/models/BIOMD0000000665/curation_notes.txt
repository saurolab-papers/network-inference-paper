A figure similar to figure 5B of the reference publication was produced. The figure shows cell-surface complex (Cs) concentration for varied dissociation rate constants (kr) between 0.00138 and 0.138. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated in MATLAB R2014.
