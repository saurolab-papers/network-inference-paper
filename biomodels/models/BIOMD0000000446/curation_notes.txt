Figure 12 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The figure shows the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) following the rate of total unfolded protein accumulation (mUFPT). Set mUFPT to 12, 15 and 18 for mild, moderate and severe stress conditions.
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.8 (Build 38). Figures were generated using Gnuplot.
