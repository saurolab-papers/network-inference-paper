Figures 2f and 2i of the reference publication have been reproduced here. Concentration  of extracellular glucose and lactate are plotted over time. The profile moves along the x-axis depending on the neuronal stimulation start, strength and duration.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
