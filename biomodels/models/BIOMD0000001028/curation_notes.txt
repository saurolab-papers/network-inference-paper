Figure 5 reproduce from the literature. Model encoded and annoated using COPASI 4.33(Build246) and model simulation results were reproduced using telluirum package in python 3.8. Simulation plots created using matplotlib python library. The simulations were made for a single PO dose of 500mg, 1000mg, and 1500mg metformin hydrochloride, which corresponds to 389.2mg, 778.4m,g, and 1167.6mg metformin respectively.
