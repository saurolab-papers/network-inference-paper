Steady state behavior of the model for varying concentrations of MAPKK2 and MAPKK1, as in supplementary figure 9 of the article. Each curve is calculated for a different initial concentration of MAPKK1.
A parameter scan to determine the steady states at different parameter values was performed using Copasi 4.6.
