Figure 5 of the publication has been reproduced here. Figure 5As are generated by varying the amount of ARD proteins (Atot) from 0 to 500, keeping gamma = 0 and epsilon = 5. Figure 5Bs are generated by varying gamma, the binding affinities of FIH for hydroxylated ankyrin repeats from 0 to 0.1, keeping Atot = 100 and epsilon = 5. Figure 5Cs are generated by varying epsilon, the timescale of basal HIF? turnover relative to the timescale of ARD protein turnover from 1 to 10, keeping Atot = 100 and gamma = 0.02. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32).
