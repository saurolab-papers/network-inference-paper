Figure 2 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. To simulate the curves of Figure 2, (i) set a=1 ("1" corresponds to multiple dose administration, "0" corresponds to single dose administration), (ii) set DOSE_zf to 400 or 600 (this corresponds to the dosage of Zileuton in mg), and (iii) set DOSE_ml to 10 or 50 (this corresponds to the dosage of Montelukast in mg).

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot.

The Copasi file corresponding to each of these four conditions (i.e.,DOSE_zf=400,600mg and DOSE_ml=10,50mg) that can be used to generate the plots, can be downloaded (see below).
