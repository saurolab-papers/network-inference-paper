I reproduced Fig.3(e) by using cps file and COPASI. The figure plotted is tumor size, which is Tumor Cell Population P + Damaged Tumor Cells D. 
Extra data provided from the author: 
b=1.9 m^(2), β=2.1*10^(-6)/ml and C is equal to b*β*d with d=150mg/m(^2), that is 0.5985 µg/ml.
One dose given on days 1 to 5 and 23 rest days. there are 20 cycles.
Initial values: P=144.9520751, C=0, D=0

COPASI is not very stable when performing the events, please use dose1-5 to check if 20 doses are given at correct times.
