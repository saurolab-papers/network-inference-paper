The model reproduces Figure 8a of the reference publication. The species are defined in molecules/micrometer cubed units in the model. The top 2 plots are in molecules/micrometer cubed units. The bottom two plots corresponds to that of the paper which are in microMolars (obtained by converting molecules/micrometer cubed to microMolars by multiplying by the converting factor 1/602).
