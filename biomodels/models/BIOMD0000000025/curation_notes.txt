Reproduction of figure 1 of the original publication using octave.

To simulate this model, the sbml file first was translated to matlab using the SBW online translator (http://sys-bio.org/SBMLTranslator/). A function to intra- and extrapolate the delayed variables was added and the time course simulated using ode23. The changes to the code and detailed instruction on how to perform the simulations are available on demand, and, hopefully soon, from our FAQ.    

As the initial conditions are not known, the time course is different from the published results for the first 15 hours and the oscillations are shifted.
