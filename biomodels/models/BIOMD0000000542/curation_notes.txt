Aggregation-prone simulation from Figure 6 has been reproduced here. Percent change in microtubule bound 4R tau protein with respect to basal concentration during 5000 arbitrary units. 

Parameters are took from “Run1” of “Disease Params” sheet, on Dataset S1. 
To run this plot, the specie “Tau04MT” from Table S1 using the reactions from Table S2 is divided by the specie “Tau04MT” from Table S1 using the reactions from Table S2 including a 5-fold increase in the parameter associated with the binding of normally phosphorylated tau 3R to microtubules (reaction 12).

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.12 (Build 81) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The models with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below links:
	- Copasi file of “Tau04MT” basal concentration
	- Copasi file of “Tau04MT” concentration when 5-fold increase in reaction 12 is implemented
