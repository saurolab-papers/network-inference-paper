Instead of interpolation of the mean daily anakinra concentration as seen in the original figure, the curated model uses the subcutaneous administration equations available in the supplementary materials. This results in an oscillating anakinra concentration (top left panel) and IL1R modulation (middle left panel).

The Glucose, Insulin and Proinsulin reactions were modelled through ODEs instead of algebraic assignments. This removed circular dependencies in the model. As a result however, the curves are slightly different to the original. The peak effect is reached later than observed in the original simulations.

Simulations were carried out in Copasi and plotted in R.
