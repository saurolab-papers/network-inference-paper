Reproduced figure 4 and image taken from running the model in VCell. 

The following curator's comments are for the COPASI files - 

This model was encoded on COPASI 4.29 (Build 228) and reproduces Figure 2 and 4. 

For Figure 4a set 'social_distancing_factor=10', 'governmentResponseFactorToDiagnosedInfected=0', 'lockdown_duration=7' and 'timeFraction_lockdown=0.55' and run for t=365.

For Figure 4b set 'social_distancing_factor=10', 'governmentResponseFactorToDiagnosedInfected=0', 'lockdown_duration=7' and 'timeFraction_lockdown=0.7' and run for t=365.

For Figure 2 set 'governmentResponseFactorToDiagnosedInfected=0', 'lockdown_duration=730' and 'timeFraction_lockdown=0.5'. Then run for t=365 with 'social_distancing_factor=1', 'social_distancing_factor=2.2', 'social_distancing_factor=10' and export the data for 'dead_corona_perc' and 'infected_tested'.
