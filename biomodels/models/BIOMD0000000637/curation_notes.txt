We reproduce the Gbg/Gtot lines for Rtot values of 330, 3300 and 33000 as shown in figure 3B. We used COPASI (4.19, Build 140) to generate this figure. We tried reproducing figure 3B using other tools, but were unable to do so. Plot data for this figure was exported from COPASI and the final plot was generated using Matlab.

We believe that the model is correct and for now, attach the COPASI files reproducing this figure.
