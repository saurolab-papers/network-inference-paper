This model was encoded and curated on COPASI 4.29 (Build 228). Figures 1A, 1C, and 1E are reproduced here. 

Information on the initial values for each species is given in the "Notes" section for each species. 

For Figures 1A, 1C, 1E - set initial values for species as given in the "Notes" section, Trigger_Wuhan = 1, Trigger_Stage_II = 1 for Fig 1A / Trigger_Stage_I = 1 for Fig 1C / Trigger_Stage_III = 1 for Fig 1E, and run a timecourse as specified in the manuscript. Keep Trigger_Hubei and Trigger_China = 0

For Figures 2A, 2C - set initial values for species as given in the "Notes" section, Trigger_Hubei = 1, Trigger_Stage_II = 1 for Fig 2A / Trigger_Stage_I = 1 for Fig 2C, and run a timecourse as specified in the manuscript. Keep Trigger_Wuhan and Trigger_China = 0

For Figures 3A, 3C - set initial values for species as given in the "Notes" section, Trigger_China = 1, Trigger_Stage_II = 1 for Fig 3A / Trigger_Stage_I = 1 for Fig 3C, and run a timecourse as specified in the manuscript. Keep Trigger_Wuhan and Trigger_China = 0
