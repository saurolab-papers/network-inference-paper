The simulation result corresponds to Fig 5A and 5B of the paper. The plots in the publication show the time profiles of Ras-GTP in the Golgi and Plasma membrane for various palmitoylation rates. The value used in the model is 0.00015849, which is not shown in Fig 5 but is shown in Fig S2 of the supplement. Results obtained with MathSBML.
