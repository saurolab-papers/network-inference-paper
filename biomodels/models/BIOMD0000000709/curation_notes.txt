Figure 4b of the reference publication has been reproduced. Simulation of the allee effect model for avian population. Initial conditions stated in the publication did not reproduce the figures and the author was contacted for the correct values. The correct initial conditions are S_a(0)= 100000, I_a(0)= 1000, S_h(0)= 1000000, I_h(0)= 0, R_h(0)= 0, Pi_h=30 and beta_a value as per the legend.  The model was simulated using Copasi 4.22 and the figure was generated using Python 2.7.
