This is a model created on COPASI 4.27 (Build 217) which reproduces the Figures 2b, 2d, 3b, 3d, 4b, 4d in the article. The y-axis in the uploaded images represent cases as a fraction of the total population.

To reproduce Fig 2b, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 0, epsilon_modifer = 1, alpha_modifer = 1 and run for t = 45 d
To reproduce Fig 2b, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 0, epsilon_modifer = 1, alpha_modifer = 1 and run for t = 350 d 

Set alpha_modifier = 0 for the remaining 4 cases
To reproduce Fig 3b, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 1, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 0, epsilon_modifer = 1 and run for t = 350 days.
To reproduce Fig 3d, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 1, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 0, epsilon_modifer = 1 and run for t = 350 days.
To reproduce Fig 4b, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 1, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 0, epsilon_modifer = 0 and run for t = 350 days.
To reproduce Fig 4d, set Event_trigger_Fig3b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig3d = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4b = 0, Event_trigger_Fig4d = 1, epsilon_modifer = 0 and run for t = 350 days.
