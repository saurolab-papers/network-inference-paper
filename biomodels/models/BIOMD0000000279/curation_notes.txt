The model reproduces Figures 1B and 2A of the reference publication. 1) The panel (A) of the curation figure corresponds to Figure 1B of the publication. These plots shows the simulation of Osteoclasts (x1), Osteoblasts (x2) and Bone Mass (z%) upon stimulation by PTH with varying g21. Increase in g21 from -0.5 to -0.1 (green), 0.1 (blue) and 0.3 (red) as a 1-day burst.

2) The panel (B) of the curation figure corresponds to Figure 2A of the publication. The changes in bone mass are observed by an increase in g21 for 1-day from -0.5 to 0 (green), 0.1 (blue) and 0.15 (red). The plots are made for three sets of g12 and k2 values.

The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32). Copasi files corresponding to each of the plots in the curation figure would be available for download.
