Figure 4 - dppERKnuc response to NGF (solid line) is reproduced here using SimBiology Version 5.1, MATLAB Version 8.4 (R2014b). 

Note: The SBML model was generated from SimBiology. The corresponding SimBiology project file (.sbproj) can be downloaded from the below link. Copasi do not generate appropriate simulation results for the following reasons, 1) "fast" reactions are not recognised, 2) Units definitions are not handled well.
