Reproduction of some of the time courses in Fig 3 of the original publication. The calculations were performed using Copasi 4.5.31. 
The time courses were aligned at their maximal internal Calcium concentration, but time was not rescaled to the circadian time, giving slightly different graphs.
As described in the article, the Ryanodine blockade was simulated by setting the parameter VM3 (v3 in the article) zero, nimodipine application by setting g_Ca constant and zero.
