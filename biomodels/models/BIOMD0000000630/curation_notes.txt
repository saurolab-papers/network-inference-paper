We used COPASI 4.19 (build 140) to reproduce figure 2B from the paper. A normal distribution with a mean initial concentration of plasmin = 0.1 and a standard deviation of 0.02 was used to seed the initial concentration of plasmin. 

A total of 100 initial concentrations were used to reproduce the plot shown in the figure. The figure shows the existence of two different steady states, as seen in the paper, albeit with a steady state values of 0.008 and 0.036
