Figure 3 of the reference publication is reproduced here. There is a typo in the legend in figure3a of the paper. 2HFE-TfR should be HFE-TfR. This has been checked with the author. The Copasi file with the conditions to simulate this plot can be downloaded from the link below. 
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64). The plots were generated using gnuplot.

Additional information: The author has provided additional information to generate other plots in the paper.
1. To recreate Figure 4 of the paper, add another parameter scan for HFE expression between 2.3469e-13 and 2.3469e-11.
2. The setup for Figures 5, 6 and 7 of the paper involves defining a number of global quantities and initial concentrations.  [See attached Copasi file below]
