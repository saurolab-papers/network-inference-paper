Figure A and B corresponds to the figures 1C and 2A of the reference publication. In both figures the plot in red corresponds to the wild type (WT) LHY mRNA. In figure A and B, the plot in green represents mutant LHY mRNA in TOC1 background (the translation rate of TOC1 mRNA (p2) was changed to 0.004324) and in gi background (the translation rate of Y mRNA (p4) was changed to 0.07455), respectively. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.5 (Build 30).
