The model reproduces Figure S4 of the reference publication, that correspond to the effect of heregulin-beta (black). In order to reproduce the plot that correspond to the effect of pertuzumab (blue), the initial concentration of Per should be set as 300000. For more details about the scaling factor used in the concentration of Per, look in the notes of the "Per".

The data were obtained by simulation the model using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35). The plots were made using Gnuplot.
