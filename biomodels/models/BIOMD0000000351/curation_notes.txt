Figure 3 of the supplementary material of the reference article has been reproduced here. Time evolution of all the variables in the model are plotted, under the influence of a step input of auxin level (auxin=5, when time>1000; 0.11, otherwise). pi_A is varied between 0 and 2 by steps of 0.1.
The model was integrated simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34). Data were obtained from Copasi and plotted using Gnuplot.
