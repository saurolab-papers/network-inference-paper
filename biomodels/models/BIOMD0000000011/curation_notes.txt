Reproduction of the signal-response curve of the model without scaffolding from figure 2 C. The calculations were performed using the parameter scan task of Copasi 4.6. The initial concentration of RAFK was varied from 0 to 2 uM with 100 intervals and a time course run over 100 sec at each. The concentration of MAPK-PP was integrated over the range of the whole time course.
