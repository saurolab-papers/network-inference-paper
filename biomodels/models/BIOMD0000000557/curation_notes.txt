The figure that is generated here is not the exact reproduction of figure 4 of the reference publication, but the outcome is the same. The total nuclear ERK i.e. the sum of ERKn, pERKn and ppERKn is plotted against time, with varying values of STYX (from 0 to 5000). In the model, STYX=5000 denotes control and STYX=500 denotes knockout.

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
