Figure 2A, 2B , 2C and 2D (image included) is reproduced with different c values (as per data given in Literature for each simulation i.e. c=5e-5 (fig2a), c=0.01 (fig2b), c=0.02 (fig2c) and c=0.035 (fig2d). Model is simulated for the time given in Literature for each figure. Model is created and simulation plots were generated  using COPASI 4.24 (196). Attached image is an reproduced simulation plot for literature figure 2d. In literature, the y axis value has been scaled to 1E-5 thus plot value seems different but its same (if compared with pre-scaling values).
