The model has been encoded using COPASI 4.24 (Build 197) and the figure 1 of the publication has been reproduced using COPASI.

The model has the initial value for v as 0.6 not 0.5 as it seems there are some noises when 0.5 is used as the value of v. The figure looks exactly as the one present in the figure of the publication
