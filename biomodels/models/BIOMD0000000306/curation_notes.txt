Bifurcation diagram as in fig 2b of the original publication. the steady state (stable: thick line, instable: dashed) and the maximal and minimal oscillatory concentrations (circles) of R are plotted against varying input values of S. The diagram was created using XPP with the xpp version of the model automatically generated by the BioModels.net converter.
