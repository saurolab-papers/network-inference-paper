Figure 2 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. To obtain figure 2C and 2D, change c_T to 9.5 (11% increase of transport capacity). The paper use weeks as time scale, the model uses days instead of weeks (as the data was taken from mice at days 50, 100, etc - co-author of the paper and submitter of the model reported). The data was generated by simulating the model using SBMLSimulator 1.2.1, and gnuplot was used to generate the plots.
