The model is encoded using COPASI 4.24 (Build 197) and plots are generated using R ggplot package. Mode simulation time for left figure is 20 days and right figure is 2 days. 

Two figures were drawn from the model based on the data provided in the paper. The values of panic intensity and protection was changed to 0.1 and 0.1 by trial and error. 
Several data were missing in the paper like whole population but the value was set to 10 as the xml file provided contained that parameter. 

Both the figures are exact match with the given figure as per pattern but the value is 10 times in the y -axis.
