Figure 7 of Supplementary material 5 (derived from Figure 5 of the reference publication) has been reproduced here. Dynamics of several alpha-synuclein conformations are simulated during 7 days (600000 seconds). 

The simulation was done using SBML odeSolver. The plot were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
