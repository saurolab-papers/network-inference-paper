Figure 1 of the reference publication is reproduced here. The model as such reproduces figure C (in the presence of both IL1 (=100) and OSM (=1000)). To reproduce figures A (IL-1 only), set IL1 = 100 and OSM = 0. To reproduce figure B (OSM only), set IL1 = 0 and OSM - 1000.
The simulation was done using SBML odeSolver. The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
