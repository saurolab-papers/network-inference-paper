Figure 3 ( Global behaviour of the beta-insulin-glucose model) of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model as such has the initial concentration corresponding to saddle point (beta Cell Mass = 37; Insulin= 2.8; Glucose = 250). In order to obtain figure 3, the initial concentration of beta Cell Mass, Insulin and Glucose was changed to 0, 0 and 600, respectively.

The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.6 (Build 33).
