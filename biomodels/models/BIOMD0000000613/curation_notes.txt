Figures 3 and 4 were reproduced.

SBML L3V1 was constructed in QTAntimony and the simulations were carried out in Copasi. Figures were generated in R.

Some disagreement was seen in peak TERISC values between both R and SBML models, this appeared to be of little or no consequence to the other variables.

Peak PTH levels were also seen to be different in Figure 3B. However, it is unclear whether this is the result of simulation, data manipulation or plotting. 
Despite this, the values of PTH in Figure 4, in both the original paper and the SBML model simulation, were identical (the same simulation data was used here in curation to plot in both figure 3 and 4) which implies either of the latter two reasons.
