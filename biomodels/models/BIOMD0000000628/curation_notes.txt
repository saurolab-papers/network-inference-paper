Reproduced Figure 4b from the paper using COPASI 4.19 (Build 140) and Matlab for generating the final plot. 

For this figure, we generate a time course curve by simulating the model for 600s. PP1 took 200s to stabilise after which the spike simulations were triggered. To generate this figure, we plot the curves between time 240s to 600s and subtract 200s from each time point (the x axis) to indicate the time since the point where PP1 values stabilised.
