Figure 6 of the corresponding publication has been reproduced here. The value for Cdc25 in the model is 300. The deterministic and stochastic simulation results for cAMP at different values of Cdc25 has been obtained using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55). For stochastic simulation - Stochastic (Gibson + Bruck) algorithm was used. For deterministc simulation - Determininstic (LSODA) algorithm was used. The simulation data were obtained from Copasi and the plots were generated using Gnuplot.
