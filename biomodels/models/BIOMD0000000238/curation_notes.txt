The model reproduces figure 3 of the reference publication. There is a slight inconsistency between the graph obtained by the model and that is presented in the paper. The model uses the ODE parameters given in Table 1, which presents the parameter estimates and their standard errors from the model. The author suggested that, the parameter estimates might have changed slightly from the final model, and that could be the reason of the slight variation in the graph obtained by this model and that is presented in the paper.
In the model time is defined in hours. The model was simulated for 200hrs, and for making the curation figure consistent with that of the paper, hours was converted to days. The model was simulated using SBML odeSolver. It was also tested in Copasi.
