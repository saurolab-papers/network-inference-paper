There are some errors in the figures in the original publications. I have confirmed with the author and the first figure is what the corrected figure 2 produced using MATLAB.
The second figure was produced using COPASI 4.24, setting the time to be 10.

There is a correction in the parameters, sigma_1 should be 0.3, with the confirmation of the author. sigma_1 being in 0-1 would give stable solutions.
