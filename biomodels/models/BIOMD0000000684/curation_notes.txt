The curated model reproduces figure 2 of the reference publication with k=0.1 as opposed to k=1 as stated in the figure description. The value of g was changed from 0.01 to 10 to simulate short and long immunological memory. The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated with MATLAB R2014b.
