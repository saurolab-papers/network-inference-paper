Figure 2 of the reference publication has been reproduced. The model as such reproduces  the deterministic simulation displaying the dynamics of number of T-cells, the number of mFasR(LT) and FasR(LT) molecules per T cell, the number of tumour cells; the number of mFasL(Lm) and FasR(Rm) molecules per tutor cells; the number of sFasL molecules. The simulations were performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
