Figure 3a: Reduction of CRP from baseline with administration of Tocilizumab, an anti IL6-R antibody. Doses of 560 mg every 2 weeks and 4 weeks were simulated.
Simulated as two time courses, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. The antibody Kd was matched to Tocilizumab for this case (1 nmol/l).

Figure 4d: Concentration of serum IL6, gut IL6 serum CRP and Gut pSTAT3 with a monthly (672 h) 300 mg dose regimen of IL6-R antibody.
Simulated as a Time Course for 2016 h.

Figure 4e: Suppression of CRP by IL6-R antibody after 12 weeks of monthly (672 h) doses. Three separate Kd values were assessed: 2.5, 25 and 250 pmol/l.
Simulated with a two-paramater scan for Dose and Kd, Plotted using LibreCalc.

Figure 4f: IL6-R antibody concentration in serum for 200 and 500 mg doses administered monthly (672 hours).
Simulated as a parameter scan for Dose between 200 and 500 with 1 interval.

Figure 5b: Suppression of CRP after 12 weeks of varied
monthly (672 hours) doses. This simulation includes binding of the antibody to the ligand-receptor complex. Three separate Kd values were assessed: 2.5, 25 and 250 pmol/l.
