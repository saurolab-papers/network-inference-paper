Figure 9 of the reference publication has been reproduced. Parameter values were obtained from table 1 and/or figure description. Initial conditions were obtained from steady state values (CellML) to speed up the simulation as the simulation requires a large time span (600,000 milliseconds). The simulation was performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated in MATLAB R2014b.
