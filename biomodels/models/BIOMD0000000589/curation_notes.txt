This model as such reproduces figures 2 and 3 (nonstress conditions) of the reference publication. The SBML file with the parameter values corresponding to other conditions defined in the paper (figures 4-10) can be downloaded from the below link. The model was simulated using Copasi v4.15 (Build 95), and plot was generated using Gnuplot.

Note: The model is not working in other simulation tools such as, SBML Simulator, SBML odeSolver - due to integration error.
