Figure S12E has been reproduced here using Copasi 4.16 (Build 104).

Note: The initially submitted SBML file did not work for reproduction. Clemens KÃ¼hn, one of the authors, identified that the rate law for reaction v16r should be proportional to kv16r_1VARIABLE, instead of kv16r. Note that there is an error in Text S1 from the publication, which does not record the usage of kv16r_1VARIABLE.
