The SBML file of this model was provided by the authors in the paper. The file did not have any errors and simulations worked just fine. Figure 4B in the paper is reproduced here. The two curves in the graph indicate active Ras (red) and active Rap1 (blue). One observation was that all the parameters in this model are represented in units of minutes.
