Figure 4a (left) in the paper. Parameter scan over EGF (lTot in model) and plot the values of UbNorm and TyrNorm after 120 seconds of simulation.

The model units for EGF (lTot) are nM (nano Molar), while to compare to experiments we converted them in ng/ml (the conversion factor is 0,17, i.e. 17 nM = 100 ng/ml).
