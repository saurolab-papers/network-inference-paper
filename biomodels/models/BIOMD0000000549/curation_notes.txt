Simulations of Figure 12 in paper. 
Describing the effects of a time(age)-dependant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production rates on pro (p) and anti (a) - inflammatory cytokine levels. 
The three columns illustrate how differing basal anti-inflammatory production rate (a4) values affect cytokines and suggest differing disease state qualities such as an individual with relapsing and remitting arthritic episodes where a4 = 15.
