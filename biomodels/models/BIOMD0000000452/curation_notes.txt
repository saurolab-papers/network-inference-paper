The paper describes two models of EGFR signalling in normal (this model - MODEL1304020000) and NSCLC (MODEL1304020001) cells.  Figure 4 of the reference publication is reproduced, where plot in blue (normal cells) can be obtained from this model (MODEL1304020000) and the plot in red (NSCLC) was obtained from MODEL1304020001.
The model was simulated using COPASI v4.8 (Build 35). The plots were obtained using Gnuplot.
