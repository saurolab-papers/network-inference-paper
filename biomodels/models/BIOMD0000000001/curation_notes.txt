Recalculations of the time courses shown in figures 4 b and c of the original publication. The simulations were performed with Copasi 4.5.31 (development) and the results plotted with GNUplot. For 4b the event trigger time, t2, was changed to > 100. 

For figure 4c, t2, the time point of ligand removal, was left at 20 sec. The time axis in 4c starts directly after ligand removal.
