Figure 4 of the reference paper has been reproduced here. Note that the difference in the y-axis measure is due to the difference in units.  The y-axis is in mmol/L in the model, whereas it is in g/L in the paper. The model as such reproduces the Mutant_0 condition. To simulate the Mutant_1 and Mutant_2 condition, do the following.
Mutant_1 - set rmaxACCOAC = 0.4634
Mutant_2 - set rmaxACCOAC = 0.4634; rmaxPK = 0.6113150258

The model was simulated using SBML odeSolver and the plot was generated using Gnuplot.
