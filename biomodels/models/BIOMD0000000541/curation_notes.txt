The time course of [F1,6BP] based on experimental data, for the varying concentrations of insulin (0.01 nM (blue), 1 nM (green) and 100 nM (red)), as presented in Figure 6C (dash blue, green and red plot) of the reference publication, is reproduced here. The model as such reproduces the green plot (1 nM insulin). The model with 0.01 nM and 100 nM insulin concentrations that was used to obtain the blue and red plots are provided as additional files (see below). 

The simulation was done using SBML odeSolver and the plot was generated using Gnuplot.
