The curated model, with beta = 1.5 (as opposed to 0.5) and drug treatment initiated at t=1 (approximately unchanged) and ceased at t=15 (as opposed to approximately t=30), produces a similar simulation result as that of figure 1.ii of the reference publication. The figure shows the log-values of infected CD4+ T cells (red curve corresponding to left red axis) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor cells (blue curve corresponding to right blue axis) over 200 days. Drug treatment was simulated by changing the value of s from 1 to 0.0042 for 1 < t < 15. The simulation was performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figure was generated in MATLAB R2014b.
