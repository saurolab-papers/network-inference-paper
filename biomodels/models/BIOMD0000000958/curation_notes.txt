This model was encoded on COPASI 4.29 (Build 227) and reproduces Figs 2 and 3 from the manuscript. The data needed for the [Data from reports] curve was taken from the manuscript itself.

The following parameters were changed using parameter scan. Original values are given in brackets - beta = 2.8 (2.55), delta_i = 0.035 (3.5), delta_h = 0.085 (0.3)
