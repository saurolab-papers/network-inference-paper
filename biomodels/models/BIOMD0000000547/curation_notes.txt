Figure 4 of the reference publication is reproduced using SimulationCore Solver in CellDesigner. To reproduce the figure set the "ko-8" to zero. The plot was generated using gnuplot. This parameter, ko-8, is inducing the GSH knockdown situation. In this situation the cellular GSH level is about 0.2 of its level in the wild type cells exposed to 0.1mM of arsenite for 24 hours. For more details see TableS5 (Supplementary Materials of the reference publication, Page29). The model has to be simulated for 12000 secs (=200 mins).
