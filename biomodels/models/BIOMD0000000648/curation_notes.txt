Figures 2 A-C of the reference publication have been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the normal condition. To obtain simulations in the absence (black line) or presence (brown line) of Wnt, set W=0 or W = 1, respectively in the model. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
