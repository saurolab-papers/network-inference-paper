The model is the integration of the all the sub-models (MODEL1302180003-6) described in the paper. Figure 6 of the paper is reproduced here. The model as such reproduces the plot that corresponds to NO production under shear-stress condition (red). To obtain the plot for NO production under no-shear-stress condition (green), shear activating reactions (re5, re57, re102 and re103) should be removed.
