Reproduced figures of figure 3B-D of the reference publication. Curated figure 3B illustrates SAM (red), c_methionine (blue) and 0.01*c_GSH (black) concentration over 24 hours. Curated figure 3C illustrates V_DNMT (blue), V_CBS (black) and V_GS (red) flux over 24 hours with red curve corresponding with red, right axis. Curated figure 3D illustrates c-5-methyl-THF (blue), b_GSH (black) and 10*homocysteine concentration over 24 hours. Simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and figures were generated in MATLAB R2014. c_GSH and homocysteine concentration was changed only once simulation data was imported in MATLAB.
