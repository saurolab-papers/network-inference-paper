Figure 1 and Figure 3 of the reference publication have been reproduced here. α-synuclein aggregation from the literature is fitted over time by the Finke-Watze 2-step model. 
- Figure 1 (left).  α-synuclein aggregation at 37 °C 
- Figure 3 (right).  α-synuclein aggregation at pH 5,82

Note: rate constants k2 have been defined using Parameter Scan in order to match the simulation with the figures in the reference publication, as the existing ones in the publication do not fit as reported. Simulated values are 9.5e-7 on Figure 1 and 1.57e-6 on Figure 3.

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
