The steady-state metabolite concentrations and reaction relative fluxes for human liver, as shown in Figure 2C of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The simulation was checked with both Copasi and SimBiology.

Note: SimBiology does not easily export reaction fluxes. Models for the rat liver and cortex and the human brain can be produced by substituting *_E_T parameter values with values from Tables S4a and S4b of the reference publication.
