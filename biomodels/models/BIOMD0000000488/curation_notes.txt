Figure 2B (immunisation administered on day 4) of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model time is in seconds. So, to obtain the result for 12 days, the simulation should be run for 1036800 sec (=12 days). The model was simulated using Copasi v4.10 (Build 55). The plot was generated using Gnuplot.
