The model corresponds to the core model published in the paper.  There is no corresponding
plot to be reproduced for this model. However, figures 4a and 5 have been reproduced
by extending the core model. The 9 plots in figures 4a and 5 have been reproduced in
the curation figure here.  Note that due to errors handling the events in the simulation
not all of the time course in included for the weekend and vacation conditions of 
figure 5. But enough has been simulated to include the significant period and the
subsequent response to that period.  Each each plot the three scenarios each have
a corresponding model file (SBML file) and simulation file (Copasi file) which are
available for download.  Each of the SMBL files have notes on how and what extensions
have been made.

The model was integrated and curated using Copasi 4.15 (Build 95)
