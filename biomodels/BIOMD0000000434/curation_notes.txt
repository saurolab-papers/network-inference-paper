Figure 1b of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The figure in the paper has been generated using MathSBML. The author has generated the SBML file using Copasi, and finds that with the same intial conditions and parameter sets, LDLC enters a slightly higher steady statem, when running the simulation using Copasi. This is reflected in this curation figure, generated using SBML odeSolver. 
The model was simulated using SBML odeSolver and the plot was generated using Gnuplot.
