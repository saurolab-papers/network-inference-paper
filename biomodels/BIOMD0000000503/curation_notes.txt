There are no figures in the paper that correspond to this model. 
The only result that correspond to this model is Table 6, i.e the change in steady state values of the metabolites under normal and oxidative stress condition. 
First, the steady state concentrations of the metabolites under normal (reference) was obtained. Secondly, the steady state concentrations of the metabolites at the oxidative stress condition was obtained. The following changes were made to the parameters below to simulate the stress condition:
[TDH1]: 0.351 (reference) -> 0.08775 (stress = 25% of reference);
[TDH3]: 4.20 (reference) -> 1.05 (stress = 25% of reference);
k (E4P sink) 1 (reference) -> 0.01 (stress);
k (R5P sink) 1 (reference) -> 0.01 (stress);
k (NADPH oxidase) 1 (reference) -> 100 (stress);

The changes in metabolite concentration under normal (reference) and stress conditions are presented as log10([stressed]/[reference]).

With the above settings, the last column of Table 6 of the reference publication was reproduced.

The steady state concentrations of the metabolite was obtained using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64).
