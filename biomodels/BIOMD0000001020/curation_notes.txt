Figure 3b,c,d is reproduced from the publication. Model encoded and simulated using COPASI4.33(Build426). The model is similar to MODEL2107220001 but the parameter set is different and the three condition (Raji-control+CAR-T 19, Raji-IDO+ + CAR-T19 and Raji-IDO+ + CART-19 + 1MT ) is encoded based the value of alpha in 3 different cases (details of values in paper) as switches. One just have to switch on/off the switches and plot b,c,d will be autogenerated (by-default, one will get 3b) . Plot generated using Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries using twinx feature.
