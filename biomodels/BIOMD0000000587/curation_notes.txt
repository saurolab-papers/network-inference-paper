This model correspond to the synthetic repressor-titration oscillator model described in the paper, and reproduces figure 6a of the paper. Both 1 and 3 DNA binding sites conditions are simulated by setting 3sites=0 and 1, respectively. The dimensions in the model are in molecules/cell, whereas in the paper it is in nanoMolar (nM). So, in order to reproduce the figure in the paper, the dimensions (molecular/cell) were converted to nM by dividing by 24.
Note: Do not assign any initial value other than 0 to the species G2 and G3 if running with a single DNA binding site (3sites=0).
