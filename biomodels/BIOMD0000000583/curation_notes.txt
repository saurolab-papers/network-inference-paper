Figure 3 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The difference in the y-axis measurement between the plots generated by the model and that of the paper is because the model is designed to be a scale-able representation of a 50 mg section of tissue and in the paper it is the measured values of biological quantities within the in vivo mode.

The model was simulated using SBMLSimulator.
