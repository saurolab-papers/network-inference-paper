The model as such reproduces the plot the correspond to 0.04M NaCl in figure 3a. Other plots can be obtained by changing the concentration of NaCl accordingly. 
In addition, figure 2a can be obtained by setting  Sln1BranchActive=0.

The plot data were obtained from simulating the model using SBML odeSolver. Gnuplot was used to generate the plot.
