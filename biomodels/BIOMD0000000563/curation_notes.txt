The plot representing the condition PTI+ETS+ETI in Fgure 1b of the paper,has been reproduced here. i.e. The behaviour of the system when PTI, ETS and ETI are present is plotted here, when k1 in these reactions are set to > 0 (k1=0.1).

Set k1 = 0 appropriately to simulate the other conditions, such as "no response", only "PTI" and "PTI+ETS".
i.e. To simulate the presence or absence of a particular host immune interaction:

PTI (Pattern Triggered Immunity):

PTI absent: In "PAMP recognition", set k1=0
PTI present: In "PAMP recognition", set k1>0

ETS (Effector Triggered Susceptibility):

ETS absent: In "quot;Callose suppression", set k1=0
ETS present: In "quot;Callose suppression", set k1>0

ETI (Effector Triggered Immunity):

ETI absent: In "Effector recognition", set k1=0
ETI present: In "Effector recognition", set k1>0

The model was simulated using SBML odeSolver and the plot was generated using Gnuplot.
