This model corresponds to the "Zero-dimensional Bone Model without Tumour" described in the reference publication.
Figure 2 and Figure 3 plots for "Osteoclasts", "Osteoblasts" and "Bone Mass" of the reference publication, has been reproduced here.
The model as such reproduces figure 2. In order to get figure 3, set the parameters g11=1.1, k1=0.0748, k2=0.0006395 and initial conditions C=11.16 and B=231.72.
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).
