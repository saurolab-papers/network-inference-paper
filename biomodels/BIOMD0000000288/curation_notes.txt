This model is parameterized with the median of the estimated parameters given in the supplementary material (page 8-9) of the original publication. The model reproduces figure 7 of the original publication. The curation figure is obtained by a single deterministic simulation run using Copasi v4.6 (Build 32), whereas figure 7 in the paper, plots the means and means+sd from 10000 runs. The concentration of ERK_PP (zpp), Ras-GTP (mRas) and MKP (eph) at different concentration of ligand PDGF (L) are ploted here. PDGF (L) concentrations are: red, 1 nM; green, 300 pM; blue, 100 pM; gray, 50 pM; black, 30 pM.
