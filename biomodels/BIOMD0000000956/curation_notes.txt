Following parameter changes were done - 
for Fig 2, Ro was changed to 1.954 from 2.0, Io was changed to 5 from 0.025
for Fig 3, Io value for CA was changed to 5 from 0.025, Io value for NY was changed to 29 from 0.005. These changes were the results of parameter scans in COPASI to get the best fit.

For Fig 2, keep Trigger_Lockdown = 0 and Trigger_CA = 1
Figure 2 (left) and (middle) - Perform a value-based parameter scan with Ro = 1.954 and Io having values 3956, 39.56, 0.3956, 0.003956 and plot [I] vs [Time] (global quantity)
Figure 2 (right) - Perform a value-based parameter scan with Ro having the values 4.8, 2.4, 1.8 and Io = 5 
For Fig 2 (middle), export the data and plot [Peak_time] vs log(epsilon) in R/Microsoft Excel

For Fig 3 (left), keep Trigger_NY = 0
Keep Trigger_CA = 1, Trigger_Lockdown = 0, and run a timecourse for 160 days with interval size = 1. Export the data from the generated graph
Keep Trigger_CA = 1, Trigger_Lockdown = 1, and run a timecourse for 160 days with interval size = 1. Export the data from the generated graph
Plot both exported data in R/Microsoft Excel
