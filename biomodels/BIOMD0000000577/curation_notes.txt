Figure 6a, 6i and 6j of the reference publication has been reproduced. 

The "Targets" in the figures corresponds to the experimental data, npr1 mutant for figure 6a and SA treatment for figures 6i and 6j.
To reproduce figure 6a, for 1) "NPR1 regulates TOC1 only" set both LHY_on and PRR7_on equal to 0 and 2) for "NPR1 regulates TOC1 and PRR7" set LHY_on as 0 and PRR7_on as 1. Set also, SA - "false" and WT - "false".

To reproduce figures 6i and 6j, for 1) "NPR1 regulates TOC1 only" set both LHY_on and PRR7_on equal to  0 and 2) for "NPR1 regulates TOC1 and LHY/CCA1" set LHY_on as 1 and PRR7_on as 0. Set also, SA - "True".

The zip file below contains the Copasi files that was used to obtain each of these plots. It also contains the Copasi file of the original P2012 (Pokhilko et al., 2013 model) that was used to obtain "CK" in figures 6i and 6j and the experimental data  files (Target - npr1 mutant (Figure 6a); SA treatment (Figures 6i and 6j)).
