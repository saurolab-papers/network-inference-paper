Figure 6 of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the treatment starting at 10 dimensionless time (blue line). To obtain simulations for the treatment starting at 11 (red line) and 12 (green line) set treatment_start parameter to these values. The simulations were performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
