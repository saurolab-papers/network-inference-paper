Figure 5b and S6b of the reference publication has been reproduced. The model as such reproduces Figure S6b, i.e the plot that correspond to low oxidative stress (TOX_c_k=2). To obtain the plot for high oxidative stress, set TOX_c_k to 200. 

The simulation was doing using Copasi v4.11 (Build 64). The plots were generated using Gnuplot.
