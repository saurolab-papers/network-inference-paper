Figure 4 of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model describes the dynamics of cell cycle proteins in HGF-stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes. The curves correspond to blue lines (Model 40 ng/ml HGF) from A to J. 
"DNA Content (f.c)" label in Y-axis is used uniquely in panel J while "Signal Intensity (a.u.)" is used for the rest of panels (A-I). 

The simulation was done using Copasi v4.14 (Build 89) and the plots were generated using Gnuplot. The Copasi file of the model with simulation settings can be downloaded from the below link:
