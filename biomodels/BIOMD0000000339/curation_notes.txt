Factor concentrations as fraction of their initial inactivated factor concentrations (left) during 90 seconds (the aPTT test). Simulation of the preincubation phase is not shown. The model has to be simulated for 0.025hrs (= 90secs)

The model was simulated using Copasi v4.15 (Build 95) and plot was generated using Gnuplot.
