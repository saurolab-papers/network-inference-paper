The time course of [F1,6BP] based on experimental data, for the varying concentrations of insulin (0.01 nM (blue) and 1 nM (green), as presented in Figure 6C (solid blue and green plot) of the reference publication, is reproduced here. The model as such reproduces the green plot (1 nM insulin). The model with 0.01 nM insulin concentration that was used to obtain the blue plot is provided as additional file (see below). 

The simulation was done using SBML odeSolver and the plot was generated using Gnuplot.
