Simulation was performed using COPASI 4.30 (Build 240) and the Figs 2A and 2D were generated using Excel 2010.

It should be noted that the simulation performed by the modelers is unable to exactly reproduce the other figures in the original publication. The simulation is able to generate graphs which follow the same oscillatory trends as the figures in the publication. But, the generated graphs differ in characteristics like amplitude from the figures in the original publication. The reason(s) why two of the figures are reproducible while the other figures aren't working are not understood.
