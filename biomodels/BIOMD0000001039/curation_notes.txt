Literature Figure 2 is reproduced by this model. Model encode and annotated using COPASI 4.34(Build251) and simulated using Tellurium package in Python3. For reproducing the literature results, simulation data post 0.5 hours need to be captured and plotted. Same has been done using Matplotlib/pyplot package/module in Python 3.
