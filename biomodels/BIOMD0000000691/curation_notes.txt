Time series and phase plane diagrams for figure 6, 7 and 8 have been reproduced. Time series plots (left) and phase plane diagrams (right) depict ATP (A3) concentration in two interacting cells. The steady state values (as given in table 2) were used for the initial conditions for one cell while the conditions for the second cell were set to half the steady state values. The simulations were performed for an extended time (t=200s) to negate the effects of the initial conditions on the dynamical behaviour at the start of the simulation and to ensure the disparity in amplitude remained (fig 8). The simulations were performed in COPASI 4.22 (Build 170) and the figures were generated with MATLAB R2014b.
