This model corresponds to the "Zero-dimensional Bone Model with Tumour" described in the reference publication.
Figure 4 and Figure 5 plots for "Osteoclasts", "Osteoblasts", "Bone Mass" and "Tumour" of the reference publication, has been reproduced here.
The model was simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).

Note: Using this model, Figure 6 and Figure 7 of the paper can be reproduced by setting the value of r11=0.02 and initial conditions of Osteoclasts (C=8.46) and Osteoblasts (B=340.52).
