Figure 4a: Figure 4a: Concentration of serum IL6, gut IL6 serum CRP and Gut pSTAT3 with a monthly (672 h) 300 mg dose regimen of IL6 antibody.
Simulated with a Time Course for 2016 h (12 weeks).

Figure 4b: Suppression of CRP by IL6 antibody after 12 
weeks of monthly (672 h) doses. Three separate Kd values were assessed: 2.5, 25 and 250 pmol/l.
Simulated using a two-parameter scan for dose and Kd and plotted separately on libreCalc.

Figure 4c: IL6 antibody concentration in serum for 200 and 500 mg doses administered monthly (672 hours).
Simulated using a parameter scan for dose between 200 and 500 mg with 1 logarithmic interval.

Figure 5a: Suppression of CRP after 12 weeks of varied
monthly (672 hours) doses. This simulation includes binding of the antibody to the ligand-receptor complex. Three separate Kd values were assessed: 2.5, 25 and 250 pmol/l.
Simulated using a two-parameter scan for dose and Kd and plotted separately on libreCalc.
