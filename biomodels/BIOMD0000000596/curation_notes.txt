The model reproduces the wildtype condition, i.e. figure 3E of the reference publication. The model is not opening in any other tools (tried with CellDesigner, SimBiology, DEDiscover, SBMLodeSolver) except for Copasi as it has SBML layout package. So, the simulation result has been tested using Copasi v4.16 (Build 104)(the paper has also used Copasi for simulation).
