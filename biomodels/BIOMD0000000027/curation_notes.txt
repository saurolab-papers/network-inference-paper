Reproduction of figure 3 from the original publication using Copasi 4.6. To calculate all steady states a parameter scan was performed over the initial concentrations of MAPKK and M, with the sum of the initial concentrations of Mpp and M being held constant at 500 nM. For MAPKK the scanned range was from 0 to 100 with 100 intervals, for M from 450 to 100 with 5 intervals.
