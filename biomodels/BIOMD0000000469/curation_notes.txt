Figure 2 of the paper that corresponds to the energy charge of E.coli model with linlog rate law is reproduced here. An assignment rule for "Energy charge" (i.e. energy charge = (ATP+ADP/2)/(ATP+ADP+AMP) ) has been introduced in the model to obtain the plot. Copasi file that includes this assignment rule is available for download (below).
