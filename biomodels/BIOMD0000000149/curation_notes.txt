Figure 6 of the reference publication has been reproduced. The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the normal conditions. To obtain simulations under 1) beta-cataenin mutation; set V12=0.846 (two-fold of the beta-catenin synthetic rate than the normal system. i.e. 2*0.423), 2) PP2A mutation; set Vmax4=Vmax5=33.75 (three-fourths of the PP2A activity that the normal system. i.e. (3/4)*45). The simulations were performed using Copasi 4.10 (Build 55) and the plots were obtained using Gnuplot.
