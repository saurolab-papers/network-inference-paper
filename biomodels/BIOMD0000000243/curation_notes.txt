The model reproduces figure 5D of the reference publication. The model as such reproduces the plot corresponding to Anti-CD95 conc. 1500ng/ml (black). To obtain plots corresponding to Anti-CD95 conc. 500ng/ml (blue) and Anti-CD95 conc. 250ng/ml (red), the initial concentration of L should be set as 37.74nM and 18.87nM, respectively. The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.5 (Build 30).
