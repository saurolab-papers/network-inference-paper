Ligand concentration response curve as in figure 1B of the publication. All calculation were performed using Copasi v4.6.33. Two logarithmic parameter scans over the the given ligand range with steady state determination were combined in the graph. For the low activity state, the systems initial conditions were taken from the steady state values at L = 0.001, for the high activity from L = 0.2.
