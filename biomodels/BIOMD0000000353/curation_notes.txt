Figure 7 and Figure 11 of the reference article has been reproduced here. The concentrations of Beta-amylase and Isoamylase are in gram/L in the model. So, the units for x-axis (Beta-amylase) is in gram/L in the reproduced figure whereas in the article, it is in microM.
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34).
