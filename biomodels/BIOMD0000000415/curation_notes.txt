n-hexanal concentration (relative to the maximum wild-type value (4.89e-005)) i.e. Figure 3A of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The model corresponds to the wild-type (L123) beans and reproduces the plot that corresponds to L123 (blue) in the figure. In order to obtain the plots for the mutants the following changes are to be made in the model.
L23 ; set Km(L1)& Vm(L1) to "0"
L13 ; set Km(L2)& Vm(L2) to "0"
L12 ; set Km(L3)& Vm(L3) to "0"
L2 ; set Km(L1), Vm(L1), Km(L3) & Vm(L3) to "0".

The model was simulated using SBMLsimulator 1.0.
