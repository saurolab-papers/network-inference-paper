Figure 9 (solid lines, that is corresponding to this model P2011.2.1 - PLM_71 ver 2) has been reproduced here.The model was simulated and plots were generated using SimBiology version 5.1 (Matlab R2014b)

Note: The SBML model has the kinetic laws in the form of FunctionDefinition, which is not recognized in SimBiology. So, I converted the FunctionDefintion to kinetic law using a tool in libSBML and used SimBiology to simulate the model. The kineticLaw version of the model can be downloaded from below link.
