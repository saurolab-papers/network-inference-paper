Figure 3 of the reference publication has been reproduced.  The model as such reproduces the plots corresponding to the S=62.5 condition. To obtain simulations for S=75 and S=287.5 set S to these values. The simulations where performed using Copasi 4.19 (Build 140) and the plots were obtained using Matlab R2014b.
