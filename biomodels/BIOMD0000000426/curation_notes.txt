The model compares two metabolic states generated by the specific variation of the fluxes regulated
by the activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. One state represents the metabolism of a
growing cancer cell characterised by aerobic glycolysis and cellular biosynthesis (condition
H), while the other (condition L) represented the same metabolic network with a reduced
glycolytic rate, a reduced lactic acid production, but a higher mitochondrial pyruvate
metabolism, in relation to a lower activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR. 

Here, the model parameters corresponds to condition H (high PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity) and the table reproducing the corresponding metabolic fluxes (reported in the Appendix of the paper) has been obtained using Copasi v4.8 (Build 35).
