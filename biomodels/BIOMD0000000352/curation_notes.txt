Figure 4 of the supplementary material of the reference article has been reproduced here. In this model, the fluctuations of auxin level is represented using sinux function. Time evolution of the variables AUX/IAA (I) and mRNA (R) are plotted, under the influence of fluctuations of auxin level. pi_A is varied between 0 and 2 by steps of 0.1. 
The model was integrated and simulated using Copasi v4.7 (Build 34). Data were obtained from Copasi and plotted using Gnuplot.
