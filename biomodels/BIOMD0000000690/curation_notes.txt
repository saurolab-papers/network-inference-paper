Attempt at reproducing figure 7B of the reference publication. Parameter values in table 3 of the supplementary material did not reproduce the results of the publication. To correct the steady state values of the metabolites in Fig 7B, reaction rate constants were changed: FolA, 31,170 to 86,170 ; FolC, 6184 to 10,000 ; FolK, 15.8 to 24.8 and FolP, 4000 to 8000. However the metabolites in the curated lower figure take at least 100 times longer to reach steady state than what is depicted in the reference publication. The significance of the results is lost by changing parameter values other than influx and PanB V_max. The reproducibility of the results may rely on the initial conditions of the metabolites.
