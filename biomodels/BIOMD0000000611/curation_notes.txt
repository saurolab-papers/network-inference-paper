Figures 2B, G, L and Q of the reference publication has been reproduced here. The matlab script that was used to generate the figures was sent by the author Satyaprakash Nayak. The script uses the Simbiology file to generate the figures. The matlab script and the SimBiology (.sbproj) of the model can be downloaded from below link. 
Note: The SBML file was also checked for simulation using Copasi v4.15 (Build 95), and it reproduces the results in the paper. The SBML file was generated from SimBiology.
