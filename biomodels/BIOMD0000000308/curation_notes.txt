Bifurcation diagram as in fig 2a of the original publication. the steady state (blue stable: thick line, instable: dashed) and the maximal and minimal oscillatory concentrations (steel blue dotted) of Rp are plotted against varying input values of S. The diagram was created using Oscill8 v 2.0.1 with the ode version of the model automatically generated by the SBW converter.
